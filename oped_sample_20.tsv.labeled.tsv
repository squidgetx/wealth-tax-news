That's the optimistic view mouthed by Michael Reed, the CEO of New Media Investment Group, GateHouse's parent, on Nov. 14 after the deal was approved by shareholders of both companies. One would hope so, since the news business could use an injection of optimism these days. Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the ""new Gannett,"" as Reed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news organizations."

The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack. Advertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don't much care for. ""Since 2008, there hasn't been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,"" says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That's produced a strategy of ""continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news."" The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time."

Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it ""immaterial"") and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred. The private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole."

But public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can't escape the industry's economic challenges. Sacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry's coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company's news assets."

McClatchy's parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times. But the offer fell short of the $20 reportedly demanded by Ferro, who was then Tribune's largest shareholder."

Tribune, moreover, may have the best balance sheet in the industry, having paid down most of its long-term debt with the proceeds of Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong's purchase of The Times and the San Diego Union-Tribune for $500 million. That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major shareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.

For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that's where the news audience has been moving to. GateHouse hasn't been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm's practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to ""consolidate copy editing and page design"" at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters. ""GateHouse-owned newsrooms are often half the size within a matter of months,"" Abernathy reported."

It shouldn't escape notice that it's not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with ""investing for growth."" The increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder. At GateHouse, for example, the Gannett deal will enrich Fortress Investment Group, a private equity firm that created GateHouse and remained as a major player in the company through an initial public offering and a bankruptcy, and currently runs GateHouse through a management contract."

In the news business that's a self-fulfilling strategy, however. Public companies such as Gannett and McClatchy have resisted such fatalism. They have imposed sharp cuts on some of their local publications and cut back on physical delivery McClatchy is planning to end Saturday publication of all its newspapers by the end of next year, though it will post new articles online.

A new op-ed on this theme, penned for the Tuesday Wall Street Journal by Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus and New York supermarket magnate John Catsimatidis, sets a standard for the genre that other tycoons will shoot for in vain. Let's take a look. In their very first sentence, the authors declare, ""The two of us are quite rich"" -- thereby instantly establishing their piece as the Platonic ideal of Wall Street Journal op-eds."

For perspective, consider that the single biggest funding agency of biomedical research in the world is the National Institutes of Health. The budget for the NIH, however, has consistently come under attack by the Trump administration, which this year proposed to cut it by $5 billion, or 13%.

But it certainly hasn’t been equally disastrous for everyone. If you thought the wealth gap between Ebenezer Scrooge and Bob Cratchit was vast in “A Christmas Carol,” the difference between the haves and have-nots in 2020 would be enough to make Charles Dickens’ head spin. What would Dickens write about today’s America, where the total wealth gains of America’s 650 billionaires have surpassed $1 trillion since March? Where Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune increase by $72 billion during the pandemic, while Amazon faces intense criticism for failing to keep its workers safe even as thousands of them fall ill?

As the pandemic hands windfall profits to the billionaire class, our nation’s charities, particularly those serving the disadvantaged, are running out of money.

The idea is to set standards for the minimum level of annual giving from America’s wealthiest individuals and foundations so that more money can flow to organizations that can put those funds to work right away. Those who meet the benchmark would set a powerful example for what philanthropy should be doing in this time of national crisis. The math is relatively simple. The wealthiest 0.1% have an estimated tax base of around $11 trillion, but give away only around 1% annually to charity. An additional $1 trillion is parked in private foundations (where only 5% annually has to go to charities) and donor-advised funds — for which wealthy contributors can enjoy tax benefits from both of as much as 74% (and even more in high-income-tax states like California)."

A foundation with a $1-billion endowment should give $98 million — which is far more than the $50 million or the 5% of net asset value that foundations are required by law to spend annually."

Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	0	0	1	0	"Imagine for a moment that a presidential candidate made this speech: My fellow Americans, I’m here today to tell you about my economic plan. Each year, I will require every middle-class family across this great country to write a check. We will then pool the money and distribute it to the richest Americans among us — the top 1 percent of earners, who, because of their talent, virtue and success, deserve even more money. The exact size of the checks will depend on a family’s income, but a typical middle-class household will hand over $15,000 each year. This plan, I promise all of you, will create the greatest version of America that has ever existed."

Destructive, even. Well, I’ve just described the actual changes in the American economy since the 1970s. [ Sign up for David Leonhardt’s daily newsletter — with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web. ] Economic output — known as G.D.P. — per person has almost doubled over this period. But the bulk of the bounty has flowed to the very rich. The middle class has received relative crumbs. If middle-class pay had increased as fast as the economic growth, the average middle-class family would today earn about $15,000 a year more than it does, after taxes and benefits. Instead, that middle-class family effectively forfeits the money to the rich, year after year after year. (Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary, first got me thinking about calculations like these.)"

Some of them, like technological change, stem mostly from private-sector forces. But government policy plays a crucial role. Tax rates on the wealthy have fallen sharply . Labor unions have been undermined . Big companies have been allowed to grow even bigger and more powerful. The United States has lost its lead as the most educated country in the world. More often than not over the past 40 years, our government has helped the rich at the expense of everyone else. As a result, economic inequality has reached Gilded Age levels."

It’s radical because soaring inequality is starting to threaten the basic fabric of American life. Many people have grown frustrated and cynical. Average life expectancy, amazingly, has fallen over the past few years. Over the sweep of history, the main reason that societies have declined, as the scholars Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have written , is domination “by a narrow elite that have organized society for their own benefit at the expense of the vast mass of people.” The name of Acemoglu’s and Robinson’s book on this phenomenon is, “Why Nations Fail.”"

The proposals are instead efforts to undo some of the extreme economic changes of recent decades and to ensure that most Americans workers — not just a narrow elite — fully benefit from economic growth. The proposals also happen to be popular, broadly speaking. On social issues, like abortion and immigration, the country is deeply divided. But clear majorities support higher taxes on the wealthy, higher taxes on corporations, more education funding and expanded government health insurance. No wonder: Americans don’t resent success, but they do resent not receiving their fair share of economic growth."

Cory Booker and Kamala Harris want to lift the after-tax pay of the middle class and poor. Kirsten Gillibrand and others support reducing major living costs, like child care and education. Perhaps most important, some Democrats have begun pushing for a wealth tax — to reverse the upward redistribution of the past 40 years. Warren has proposed an annual 2 or 3 percent tax on large fortunes. Bernie Sanders has proposed a big increase in the inheritance tax."

Do you know who already pays a wealth tax? Middle-class Americans. It’s called the property tax, as Noah Smith of Bloomberg Opinion has noted. Every year, homeowners pay a percentage of their house value in tax. A house, of course, is the biggest asset that most families own. If middle-class families can pay an annual tax on their main source of wealth, wealthy families can, too. The United States as we have known it — optimistic, future-oriented and more powerful than any other nation — cannot survive the stagnation of mass living standards over many decades. I’m glad to see that some political leaders understand this and are trying to recapture a core feature of American life."

Perhaps he stayed in an attempt to increase Democratic turnout in Wisconsin to help oust a right-wing state supreme court justice.

First, ""No one ever changed the party as much as Sanders."" Second, ""Now begins the struggle to win over the Bernie Bros."" It is understandable that some Democrats — eager to avoid a schism similar to that which occurred in 2016 — are falling over themselves to assuage Sanders's ego, but let's not get carried away. The ""Bernie changed the party"" line suggests that the party did not overwhelmingly choose a center-left successor to President Barack Obama. But it did! And it has rallied around someone who rejected Medicare-for-all, a wealth tax, left-wing isolationism and the entire ""capitalism is evil"" stance. Sanders got beaten badly week after week, never changing his message. That message simply did not register with more than about 30 percent of the party. Twitter does not represent the party. The party did not shift far left, as many in the media predicted (egged on by the loudest voices on the left). If anything, Biden's wins show that the heart of the party rests with moderate African Americans — to whom all Americans are indebted for lifting a viable, electable nominee to oust President Trump.

They've already signaled they will line up behind Biden and have expressed their determination to oust Trump.

Billionaire Eli Broad chimed in with a pro-wealth-tax New York Times op-ed. Certainly their self-abnegating spirit is consistent with the policy tendency that Democratic candidates expressed during their first debates; and the letter spoke favorably of a direct tax on wealth similar to the one Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has proposed, which would put a 2 percent levy on assets above a $50 million threshold and 3 percent on assets over $1 billion."

Undeniably, too, the 2017 tax law that President Trump and a Republican Congress enacted showered billions of dollars worth of tax relief on upper-income people and businesses. Incredibly, news reports indicate the Trump administration is considering executive action to create yet another tax reduction that primarily benefits the rich — indexing capital gains to inflation.

Indeed, it's all too likely that a wealth tax would bring in less revenue than advocates anticipate, in part because millionaires can afford the best accountants and lawyers.

Warren, on the other hand, is the candidate of the affluent, the educated and the white, what Republican polling firm Echelon Insights recently dubbed the ""Acela Party."" It might seem a bit strange that wealth taxes are being promulgated by a candidate who caters to white professionals with healthy household balance sheets, while the former mayor of Newark is making such investment-bankerly noises. But in fact there's a certain logic to it. After all, wealth taxes — as Booker ably pointed out — don't really make much sense as a technocratic policy matter."

This is a fairly useless policy goal unless you happen to be in direct competition with wealthy people for social status and scarce resources such as elite school places. The best way to understand a wealth tax, in other words, is not in terms of rich and poor but as an intra-elite battle. The two sides are characterized by what New York Times columnist David Brooks once dubbed ""status-income disequilibrium."" One side consists of people whose elite jobs are well-paid compared with the national average but poorly paid compared with similarly educated and successful people in more mercenary fields, and who can therefore generally only access the best resources by leveraging family money, professional prestige or social capital. On the other side are those with more lucrative occupations who crassly buy their way in."

So it's up to the broader progressive movement to make the comparisons we know exist. It's up to movement leaders to flip the script. They can do so in a number of ways: by making the case that these two progressive candidates should work together (as Democracy for America did), by waiting to endorse (as many labor unions are doing), by endorsing both Sanders and Warren, or, as the American Prospect's Harold Meyerson put it, simply by making Sanders and Warren a greater priority than Sanders vs. Warren."

Progressives who, both before this latest back-and-forth and now, are lifting up both Sanders and Warren, are being principled and strategic. In our winner-take-all political system, the candidate who wins the nomination controls the direction of the party.

That's no way to expand the progressive lane. And a fractured movement foreshadows trouble for progressives at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. With the possibility of a brokered convention, progressives would be better off entering with 50 percent or more of the delegates.
