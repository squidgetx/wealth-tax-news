2019-07-30	The Washington Post (Online)	Kamala Harris steps away from the far-left cliff on health care	txt-opeds/2266738077.xml.txt	The Post reports: Sen. Kamala D. Harris released a health-care plan Monday that reshapes her stance on the sharply divisive issue, proposing a government-run system that would allow private insurance as long as it follows Medicare's coverage rules. The plan is in many ways a middle ground between Sen. Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-all proposal and former vice president Joe Biden's desire to build on the current system. ... Harris had previously said private insurance should continue to exist only to cover supplemental medical expenses, such as cosmetic surgery, foreign travel insurance and other services not covered by Medicare. But on Monday she said she would allow a variation of Medicare Advantage plans, private policies that offer the same services as Medicare but often use a provider network. Harris also wants to expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental care, as well as hearing aids and mental health services.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-07-30	The Washington Post (Online)	Kamala Harris steps away from the far-left cliff on health care	txt-opeds/2266738077.xml.txt	In stepping back from a plunge over the far-left cliff, she apparently has listened to policy concerns (e.g. cost, logistics) and taken in polling data that show voters are concerned more about universal coverage and price than about adoption of a single-payer plan. The Post notes, ""Harris told reporters she'd heard three main concerns about Medicare-for-all on the campaign trail: that it was too big to implement quickly; that it would require middle-class tax increases; and that 'people don't want government or anyone to take away their choices.' "" She sounds an awful lot like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Biden (who have resisted even the term ""Medicare-for-all""), not to mention savvy center-left pundits warning candidates not to adopt an ideologically pristine and politically risky plan that lacks a good policy rationale.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-07-30	The Washington Post (Online)	Kamala Harris steps away from the far-left cliff on health care	txt-opeds/2266738077.xml.txt	Right-leaning pundits seem incensed that Harris is keeping a role for private plans rather than sticking to maximalist rhetoric. She finances the plan not with a wealth tax (like Warren's heavily criticized plan) but with a tax on financial transactions. Umm, that's a better, more realistic option, isn't it? Harris's rivals are going ballistic, accusing her of trying to be all things to all people. They might not mean it as such, but that's called good politics. Getting the best of both worlds — rallying the base without losing the center (or giving a pathway to Medicare without scaring people) — is exactly how one wins elections, even primary elections in which the party is properly concerned about giving President Trump ammunition to unload on the eventual nominee. Sanders's campaign put out a blatantly misleading statement accusing Harris of trying to ""privatize"" Medicare. Lily Adams, Harris's communications director, tells me, ""It's just not true and frankly they know it. Her plan immediately expands coverage, is most closely modeled after the current Medicare system that works and is the best way to get to universal coverage and take on big insurance companies.""	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

In Harris's case, she avoids the pitfalls of Sanders's plan without giving up on improved access. ""Senator Harris's plan is an effort to balance idealism and pragmatism. It says in effect: We have a mandate to get everyone affordable health care and put people over profits — but we don't need to tear down the things people have and they like in order to do it.""	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-07-30	The Washington Post (Online)	Kamala Harris steps away from the far-left cliff on health care	txt-opeds/2266738077.xml.txt	Harris smartly recognized that Democrats win on health care if they make the election a choice between taking away health-care coverage (as Trump would do) or solidifying Obamacare/extending access to health-care coverage. If Democrats become advocates for destroying the entire system and creating chaos and ""socialism,"" then Democrats will wind up handing Trump the advantage. Harris has used her telegenic personality, prosecutorial flair and precise policy positioning (left, but not too far left) to balance three competing concerns: Rally the critical African American base, endear herself to the progressive wing of the party and preserve her general-election credibility — without which Democrats desperate for a win are unlikely to nominate her.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

2020-04-08	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders is out. And the insincere praise begins.	txt-opeds/2387534568.xml.txt	Quite belatedly, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced Wednesday that he is ending his presidential campaign. The race was effectively over on Super Tuesday, but Sanders and his devoted Bernie Bros are not known for their selfless devotion to party, so his futile race dragged on for another month. Perhaps he stayed in an attempt to increase Democratic turnout in Wisconsin to help oust a right-wing state supreme court justice. Or maybe he would have stayed in even longer, but the sight of people endangering themselves to vote during a pandemic was simply too much to bear. In any case, his second run — far less effective than his first — is over.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-04-08	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders is out. And the insincere praise begins.	txt-opeds/2387534568.xml.txt	Democrats, aided by the mainstream media, are now putting out two rather disingenuous storylines. First, ""No one ever changed the party as much as Sanders."" Second, ""Now begins the struggle to win over the Bernie Bros."" It is understandable that some Democrats — eager to avoid a schism similar to that which occurred in 2016 — are falling over themselves to assuage Sanders's ego, but let's not get carried away. The ""Bernie changed the party"" line suggests that the party did not overwhelmingly choose a center-left successor to President Barack Obama. But it did! And it has rallied around someone who rejected Medicare-for-all, a wealth tax, left-wing isolationism and the entire ""capitalism is evil"" stance. Sanders got beaten badly week after week, never changing his message. That message simply did not register with more than about 30 percent of the party. Twitter does not represent the party. The party did not shift far left, as many in the media predicted (egged on by the loudest voices on the left). If anything, Biden's wins show that the heart of the party rests with moderate African Americans — to whom all Americans are indebted for lifting a viable, electable nominee to oust President Trump. Sanders's ""movement"" is far smaller than he would have liked us to believe.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2020-04-08	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders is out.

It is hard to fathom the mindset of someone who would prefer an unfit narcissist who opposes virtually every principle and value Democrats hold dear to Obama's vice president. It is of a piece with those who preferred Jill Stein in 2016. There is no reaching such people. Soliciting them is a waste of time. The rest of the Sanders coalition should not need much courting. They've already signaled they will line up behind Biden and have expressed their determination to oust Trump. Other than not gratuitously attacking them, no great effort should be required to keep them in the fold. (Ironically, Sen.

He must defeat Republican attempts to suppress the vote (including the GOP's opposition to voting by mail, which forces voters to choose between their right to vote and risking their lives by voting in person during a pandemic). He must hold Trump to account for his grotesque negligence in responding to the coronavirus, the greatest failure in presidential leadership, and for his stomach-turning corruption.

2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	The nonprofit news organization ProPublica has just performed a significant public service by publishing federal tax records of some of America’s leading billionaires, including Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk. The records are eye-opening, showing how the super-rich have gained from a tax system rigged in their favor. As ProPublica reports, the system allows them to pay a minuscule portion of their wealth, and sometimes their conventional income, in taxes. It’s not their tax-avoidance methods that are so striking, for those are familiar to anyone paying attention, but the scale of tax breaks. This is a system designed for the fortunate few by professional tax dodgers.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), in 2019 Bezos’ wealth grew by $99 billion from 2014 to 2018, but he paid only about 1% of that growth in federal taxes. Musk’s fortune grew by about $14 billion in that time frame, but he paid only about 3.27% of that increase in federal taxes. Statistics like these illustrate the adage that what’s really scandalous in American society isn’t what’s illegal, but what’s legal. Commentary on economics and more from a Pulitzer Prize winner. All the tax-avoidance devices documented by ProPublica are, in fact, perfectly legal. But they’re useful chiefly for millionaires and billionaires who have the legal flexibility to sequester their wealth in categories that enjoy either low tax rates or infinitely deferrable tax liabilities.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	What’s most important about the disclosures is that they point to a remedy for economic inequality that has been heard more and more often: Tax wealth, not merely income. Wealth taxes were proposed by Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders during their presidential campaigns. Warren reintroduced her idea in Congress this year. The scale of wealth concentration in a few hands makes a wealth tax imperative. There’s been a certain amount of sniffing that the ProPublica disclosures are old news — that the tax dodge of unrealized capital gains and other breaks available chiefly to those with a lot of money have long been known. The disclosures “told me things I already knew,” tweeted Washington Post libertarian columnist Megan McArdle.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	I thought the ProPublica analysis of billionaire taxes was going to be exciting. Instead, it told me things I already knew: that the US tax code offers deductions for charitable donations, loan interest, and business operating expenses, and only taxes capital gains when you sell. — Megan McArdle (@asymmetricinfo) June 8, 2021 McArdle is correct; we’ve been writing about the scandal of untaxed capital gains for years. But so what? Sometimes putting a face to a scam finally gets people’s attention sufficiently to do something about it. That’s the value of the ProPublica package. McArdle — like the IRS itself — is also distracted by the side issue of how ProPublica got its hands on the tax returns, raising the issue of whether the leaker of private information should be prosecuted. There’s something to be said for that. Neither you nor I would probably relish our tax returns going rogue, whether or not they’re pristine.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	But sometimes the value of the information trumps the manner of its disclosure. Arguably, that’s the case here. Let’s examine what the billionaires’ returns tell us about the accumulation of wealth in this, the second Gilded Age. Fundamentally, they demonstrate how the U.S. tax system has been rigged to favor the accumulation of wealth and its passage from generation to generation. “This is a system designed for the fortunate few by professional tax dodgers,” Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) wrote in 2019. Wealthy Americans know the capital gains tax is their biggest loophole — and they won’t give it up easily.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	As we’ve reported, the principal device for this is the capital gains tax. Edward Kleinbard, the late taxation bard of USC, used to describe the capital gains tax as our only voluntary tax. It’s levied only when capital assets such as stocks, bonds or real estate are sold and the gains “realized.” Therefore, it can be deferred indefinitely simply by not selling. But wait, there’s more: Another feature of the tax code allows wealthy families to avoid the tax permanently. That feature is the step-up in basis upon death. What that means is that when a capital asset is bequeathed to heirs, the basis — the price originally paid for the asset — is reset to its value at the owner’s death. When the owner expires, so does the tax liability.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	Think of it this way: Say your father bought a share of stock for $100 (his cost basis) and over his lifetime it grew in value to $200. If he sold it while alive, he’d pay a tax on the $100 gain. If he kept the share and willed it to you upon his death, its cost basis would be reset to $200, and you could sell it at that price tax-free. That break alone has been estimated to cost the U.S. Treasury more than $50 billion a year. Of course, some people have to sell assets, realize their gains and pay the tax. But not, typically, billionaires like Bezos and Musk. They have the creditworthiness and expertise to capture the value of their assets without selling them. They can use the assets as collateral for loans or sell options against their holdings, for example.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	ProPublica couldn’t find much about loans in the IRS documents because they’re not reportable as income, though evidence of big borrowing by the wealthy leaks into public disclosures now and then. What’s especially insidious about the avoidance of tax on wealth by the super-rich is that much of their wealth is founded on public services paid for by taxpaying Americans. It’s widely assumed that the biggest tax scofflaws are those with the most money. A new study tells us things are much worse than anyone suspected. Take Bezos’ Amazon. The merchandise it sells customers is delivered over public highways funded by taxpayers or via airports funded by taxpayers. In 2007 and 2011, according to the ProPublica documents, Bezos didn’t rank as a taxpayer, since his tax bill came to zero.	7	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	Amazon has also gained from lax government policies, especially labor regulation. Labor leaders allege that the company’s exploitation of anti-union laws helped it defeat a union organizing drive at its warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., in April. Musk also has gained from taxpayers’ indulgence. Sales of electric vehicles by Tesla Motors, which he controls, have been assisted by taxpayer-funded incentives awarded to his customers — $319.3-million total from the state of California, and an undetermined amount from the federal government, which awarded Tesla buyers up to $7,500 per car until the credit phased out Jan. 1, 2020, when Tesla sales reached the statutory limit.	8	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	Musk paid no taxes in 2018, according to ProPublica. Both entrepreneurs have also profited handsomely from taxpayer-funded subsidies to their companies. Amazon has collected $3.2 billion in state and local tax credits, abatements, rebates and other subsidies since 2000, according to the subsidy tracker Good Jobs First. Tesla has collected $2.5 billion in state and local handouts since 2007. Good Jobs First ranks Amazon 10th and Tesla 15th in total subsidies among companies in its database. Musk’s company SpaceX has collected $106.5 million, mostly in the form of a federal loan guarantee, since 2012, the database indicates. Musk and Bezos have gone head to head in the race for federal subsidies for space exploration: After SpaceX beat Bezos’ Blue Origin for a $2.9-billion NASA contract for a lunar landing craft, a $10-billion appropriation to keep both companies on the federal payroll was introduced by Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington, Bezos’ corporate seat. The measure is being labeled a “Bezos bailout.”	9	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It’s a system that’s rigged for the top if I ever saw one. — Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) January 24, 2019 The key question raised by billionaires’ tax avoidance is what to do about it. Wyden has proposed reworking this system to shrink the advantage of the super-rich by eliminating the preferential tax rate for capital gains (President Biden has proposed this too) and by requiring that unrealized capital gains be taxed every year. Warren’s proposal would impose a 2% tax on the net value of stocks, bonds and anything else of value exceeding a total of $50 million, and an additional 1% on net worth above $1 billion.	10	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	When Warren first proposed such a scheme during the campaign, critics picked it apart as possibly unconstitutional. Warren’s advisors disputed that. Critics also said it would be difficult to administer — the price of publicly traded securities is easily discoverable, but what about rarely marketed assets such as art or collectibles? The IRS, however, is perfectly capable of determining the value of virtually any asset; the challenge lies in granting the agency expanded authority to do so. Critics also pointed out that European countries that tried wealth taxes in the past eventually abandoned the idea. But that’s no surprise: In those countries, like ours, political power is wielded by the wealthy, and they had every interest in seeing that taxing their wealth wouldn’t happen.	11	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Ed Kleinbard knew more about taxation than almost anyone and put it to work for the public interest. The Founding Fathers saw the phenomenon as flatly undemocratic. In his autobiography, Thomas Jefferson wrote of bills he had advocated to form “a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of antient [sic] or future aristocracy; and a foundation laid for a government truly republican.” His goal was to “prevent the accumulation and perpetuation of wealth in select families.” Jefferson would be appalled at the concentration of wealth in America today.

2021-06-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: More proof that a wealth tax on billionaires is desperately needed	txt-opeds/2539301689.xml.txt	As is observed by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of UC Berkeley, who were Warren’s economic advisors, the top 0.1% today control almost as much wealth as the bottom 90%. Wealth disparity on this scale has a distinctly corrosive effect on society and democracy. As political economist Benjamin Friedman wrote in 2009, its “grave moral consequences” include “racial and religious discrimination, antipathy toward immigrants, [and] lack of generosity toward the poor” — all features of our current political landscape. Those consequences are only growing worse. No one on Earth needs wealth on the scale of Bezos or Musk, especially as social needs are going unmet for lack of public resources, and especially given that the super-rich spend at least part of their wealth to ensure that they and their heirs can keep more of what they collected with the assistance of public services funded by other taxpayers.	13	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Why then should its parent-teacher associations exacerbate inequality? New York’s P.T.A.s are doing exactly that, according to city data and reports from the city’s Independent Budget Office. Across the city, the disparities are stunning. Take the P.T.A. at Public School 29, an elementary school in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn with a low percentage of pupils living in poverty. The P.T.A. reported  it raised more than $1.7 million, or more than $1,800 per student, in the last school year. Compare that with P.S. 6X, West Farms, an elementary school in the Bronx with a high poverty rate among students, which reported raising just $5,793.82, or less than $11 per student.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The data is incomplete, self-reported and hasn’t been evaluated by the city. But a recent report from the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency, shows a similar pattern. Of 132 schools reviewed by the budget office in the 2017-18 school year, the school with the lowest percentage of children living in poverty, 6 percent, received $437,000 from its P.T.A., while the school with the highest percentage of children living in poverty, 98 percent, received $2,500.

Those schools are using the additional funding for things like hiring art and music teachers and teaching assistants, according to the budget office and city education officials. That alone is upsetting. Art and music classes shouldn’t be a luxury offered to a privileged few, but should be standard in every school. Of course, parents have long used P.T.A.s to support their children’s schools, and it’s hard to begrudge them for doing so. But there’s also nothing wrong with asking New Yorkers who have more to help others — especially when the most insidious disparities in New York schools run far deeper than P.T.A. funding.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

New York is one of dozens of districts in the country that distribute the funds through a formula meant to give additional funds to schools serving children who are living in poverty or who have special needs. But the state and city have never fully funded the high-need schools under the weighted system. In 2006, the State Supreme Court ruled that New York State was allocating about $2 billion less to New York City schools than was needed to provide the “sound basic education” required by the state’s Constitution. Despite an increase in funding since then, the settlement, in a case brought by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, has never been fully funded. City officials and education experts say the state now owes the city more than $1.1 billion in this fiscal year alone.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

At the same time, many city schools with wealthier students receive more than their share under the Fair Student Funding formula the city adopted in the 2007-8 school year, while nearly 300 high-poverty schools had shortfalls of more than $500,000 each, according to the budget office.

Though that might sound radical, it’s already in action elsewhere. In Portland, Ore., one-third of funds above $10,000 raised by parents in a P.T.A.-like system  are distributed to high-need schools through a fair-funding formula. Over $1.2 million was distributed in the last school year, according to Jonathan García, the president of the Fund for Portland Public Schools, a nonprofit organization that now oversees the program. “People are bought in,” Mr. García said. “Nobody bats an eye.”	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

David Bloomfield, a professor of education law at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center, said that in New York, a city with vast wealth but also grinding poverty, P.T.A.s could make a difference. “There should be a wealth tax,” he said of such a plan. Some said sharing P.T.A. funds might be more appealing if parents knew exactly how the money was being spent, and to what school it was being given. “When people fund-raise, they want to know where that money goes.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the rest of the Democratic presidential candidates sound very similar on a whole host of issues. All are in favor of democratic reforms, including a new Voting Rights Act and financial transparency for elected leaders. All praise the Green New Deal as ""aspirational"" and support criminal justice reform, legalizing ""dreamers"" and increasing the minimum wage. They favor intermediary steps (e.g., reducing drug costs, lowering the age to qualify for Medicare), even if some want to arrive at Medicare-for-all.

He continued, ""Even our conservative and normally Trump Alliance member of Congress for this district broke with the President on the subject of tariffs, because it was not good for our economy. It also speaks, though, to the broader issue, which is that, you know, most of what accounts for the changes that have happened to our part of the industrial Midwest is technological."" Unlike many on the left and Trump supporters on the right, the mayor fessed up: ""Some of it has to do with trade, but, look, it's just easier to blame another country, or to blame immigrants, than it is to confront some of the faceless but profound changes that have come our way — to do with, for example, technology and automation.

The other 30 percent should be the ability to govern, understanding he or she won't have filibuster-proof majorities in either the House or Senate (i.e., the wish list is not going to be realized). Voters should look for ability to peel off Republican support for workable compromises, intelligence and willingness to learn, good judgment in personnel, steadiness and empathy.

Student-loan forgiveness, immigration reform, criminal-justice overhaul—check, check, check.

It is the presence of so many plans that make notable the one policy area for which Ms. Warren doesn't have a clear strategy: health care. That missing agenda item speaks volumes about the shrewdness—or deception—of her campaign. To be sure, Ms. Warren suggests she has a health-care plan.

Read the second debate transcript closely, and you'll notice she spends most of her time arguing that insurance companies bring in too much and pay out too little. When the New York Times asked this spring about her health-care plan, she listed her top priorities: protecting ObamaCare, reducing drug costs, and getting ""a consumers' bill of rights for private insurance so that people don't get ripped off."" Beyond that, she said she'd ""keep moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost.""

But I don't mean ""progressive"" in the sense of ""more palatable synonym for liberal."" I mean ""progressive"" in the sense of ""more generous to the poor than the wealthy."" Warren deserves credit for focusing the 2020 campaign on America's need to invest in human capital. A college degree is one of the best investments a person can make, with higher average returns than stocks, bonds, gold, housing.

Nine in 10 Americans say college affordability is a very big or moderately big problem, according to Pew Research Center. Some elements in Warren's plan are well-targeted to help the neediest and most marginal students enroll in postsecondary education, persist through graduation and succeed in the workplace. These include calls to expand Pell Grants, cover more non-tuition expenses and increase funding for historically black colleges and universities. But the core, blockbuster components of Warren's plan — free four-year public college and a debt jubilee — are more problematic. That's because they give bigger benefits to higher-income families than to lower-income ones that actually need the help.

For context, despite sob stories suggesting that the typical young grad is a barista with $100,000 in debt, most students borrow much less and go on to earn much more. Among students who first enrolled in college in 2003, over the subsequent six years, 44 percent hadn't borrowed at all and another 25 percent had borrowed less than $10,000.

Well, about a third of all student debt is owed by people in the top income quartile; only 12 percent is owed by borrowers in the bottom quartile. Additionally, most student debt is owed by households who have graduate degrees, a population likely to have much higher lifetime earnings. In fact, these people are borrowing in order to make more money.

Indeed, it's all too likely that a wealth tax would bring in less revenue than advocates anticipate, in part because millionaires can afford the best accountants and lawyers.

It's Republicans, after all, who are driving all matter of unpopular initiatives, from ceaseless attempts by Congress to repeal the Affordable Care Act to laws at the state level that would ban abortion in almost all circumstances. Does Biden believe in his own powers of persuasion? Or is he attempting to woo prized Obama-to-Trump voters, not to mention upscale white suburbanites reported to be appalled by Trump's behavior?

His candidacy is driven in many ways by the donor class — wealthy men and women who are loath to examine their role in our political meltdown. Wall Street interests let it be known early on that they would be thrilled if Biden entered the presidential fray. Billionaire former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who had been pondering a presidential run as an independent, has suspended that exploration since Biden's entry. This small but obscenely wealthy cohort was essential to Biden's rollout: The Wall Street Journal reported that the former vice president, fearful he would be unable to match other candidates' online fundraising immediately after their announcements, asked a small group of supporters to help line up big donors ahead of time.

He has skipped a number of candidate forums. Instead, he's letting voters in on the mechanics of raising money from big fish by permitting pooled reporters to attend his fundraising events — which is how word of what he is saying at these small gatherings is getting out. And it's the ultrawealthy and corporate interests — the people who can write $2,800 checks on a whim, or commit to raising $100,000 for Biden by the end of the year — who are afraid that their own personal financial gravy train will come to an end courtesy of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposed wealth tax or Sen. Bernie Sanders's proposal to offer all high school graduates free tuition at public colleges.

That's not a popular position with ordinary voters, but it does enjoy outsize support among the type of wealthy people who describe themselves as fiscally conservative and socially liberal, the same sort who are less likely to support implementing laws and regulations that would make it easier for unions to get a foothold in the workplace.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

No surprise, more than a few campaign gaffes have emanated from these meetings. Hillary Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" comment came at a fundraising event, as did Mitt Romney's dismissal of ""47 percent"" of voters. Few of us — Trump excepted — are so cynical that we will say or promise anything in pursuit of a goal. There's lots of evidence to suggest that Biden really does think he brings unique skills at bipartisanship to the presidential table. He did make deals with the Republicans aplenty in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. But they were deals like the Hyde Amendment and bankruptcy ""reform"" that made life harder for people in financial trouble or struggling with student debt, though not for the wealthiest. If members of the Democratic donor class are putting their faith in Biden, it's hard to blame them. The real question is whether voters will continue to support Biden as it becomes clearer and clearer that his promise of bipartisanship is simply another, more politically palatable way of saying that the rich will continue to come first.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Biden touched on his experience as a single father (after his first wife and daughter were killed) when talking about health care, his success in persuading some lawmakers to support the stimulus plan (go into their districts and campaign against them, he declared) and, of course, his tenure at President Barack Obama's right hand.

It was a lot of programs, and a lot of figures. She hit all the progressive notes (e.g., eliminate the filibuster, rein in corruption).

She began with the parable of the Good Samaritan, pointing out that the story is not so much about helping one's neighbors but defining the most vulnerable as one's neighbor, deserving of love and attention. Yes, she laid out some of her programs (e.g., a rent subsidy, a monthly credit for working people), but she also took the audience on a journey to understand how criminal justice issues become economic issues. Drawing on her experience as a prosecutor, Harris explained how the cash bail system forces many people of color to plead guilty — even when they have a defensible case — so they don't lose their children, their homes or their jobs.

In sum, Harris has the personal experience, has the details, has the ability to explain how it affects people's lives and has the ability to build a coalition. She has not, to date, given enough of that rich detail — the stories that put her in the center of major policy issues which allow people to understand that her issues extend well beyond one community.

In his brief heyday, Bankman-Fried was an adherent and promoter of the concept of “effective altruism,” which held that if life’s purpose is to do good, then the moral imperative is to make as much money as one can, so that one can give it away. Among the many problems with this notion is that billionaires tend to give their money to causes that benefit them personally, rather than the public interest. They fund personal vanities like space travel by the billions of dollars, and fight efforts to raise the incomes of their employees through, say, unionization, to the last drop of blood.

In this version it's 70%. There's also a new wealth tax on the richest player, taking 3% of assets each turn. Japanese and European players lose 1% of their cash to negative interest rates. The game comes with a handy table to estimate the players' Gini coefficient. Das Monopoly can go for hours, thanks to redistribution. It usually ends with a united playertariat upending the board and demanding that mom make pancakes. • Monopo-Ze: At the start of the game, each player picks a set of alternative pronouns: ze, zir and zirs, for example, or perhaps for the oldsters a simple they, them and their. Referring to a player without remembering to use the pronouns that ze or they designated results in a fine of $200. Infractions are self-policed.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

2019-11-12	Wall Street Journal (Online)	The Tax Increases to Come; Democrats in Congress want to raise the top individual rate to 47%.	txt-opeds/2313786364.xml.txt	The Democratic candidates for President are promising a smorgasbord of new taxes, but why wait until 2021? Last week Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen and Virginia Congressman Don Beyer unveiled the Millionaires Surtax Act, a plan to soak the top 0.2%. The bill would put an extra 10% tax on individual income above $1 million, or $2 million for married couples. This surtax would apply regardless of the income's source—whether from long-term capital gains, currently taxed at a top rate of 20%, or wages, taxed at rates up to 37%. The legislation's backers say it would raise $635 billion over a decade, citing an estimate by the left-leaning Tax Policy Center.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-12	Wall Street Journal (Online)	The Tax Increases to Come; Democrats in Congress want to raise the top individual rate to 47%.	txt-opeds/2313786364.xml.txt	Messrs. Van Hollen and Beyer would effectively lift the top tax rate on income to 47%, plus there's the 3.8% ObamaCare surtax on investment income. Tax rates haven't been that high in decades. Before Ronald Reagan's big tax reform in 1986, the top rate was 50%. Since then it hasn't broken 40%. The loopholes were also bigger and more numerous then. Reagan's 1986 law, for example, phased out the deduction for interest on credit cards and car loans. President Trump's 2017 tax reform narrowed the interest deduction for homeowners, so only the first $750,000 of a mortgage is now eligible.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-11-12	Wall Street Journal (Online)	The Tax Increases to Come; Democrats in Congress want to raise the top individual rate to 47%.	txt-opeds/2313786364.xml.txt	That 2017 law limited the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted on a federal return. It used to be unlimited, but now the cap is $10,000. There are plenty of other examples, but the basic point is that the tax base has broadened. This is desirable economically as long as the trade-off is lower rates. If Democrats now try to raise income-tax rates back to their pre-Reagan heights, special interests will soon be busy carving out new loopholes, especially for the affluent. In the 1950s, the top income-tax rate hit 92%, which applied to earnings above roughly $2 million, adjusted for inflation. Still, the wealthiest 1% of filers paid an effective income-tax rate of only 16.9%, according to by the Tax Foundation. By 2016 the top rate was 39.6%, but the richest percentile had an effective rate of 26.9%. Meanwhile, the overall share of income taxes paid by the top 1% has increased, from 26% in 1986 to 37% in 2016.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Democrats these days are also proposing to raise the regular income-tax rate, the corporate-tax rate, the capital-gains-tax rate, the dividend-tax rate, the death-tax and payroll-tax rates, while creating a new wealth tax, a new financial-transactions tax, a new carbon tax and a new pharmaceutical tax, even as they would repeal 100% business expensing and the 20% income exclusion for so-called pass-through firms.

2019-02-01	The Washington Post (Online)	In remarkable exchange, Trump offers startling view of role of free press	txt-opeds/2174661200.xml.txt	Ever since Donald Trump set the tone for his presidency by berating the press for accurately reporting on his paltry inaugural crowd size and attacking the media as the ""enemy of the American people,"" journalists and commentators have tried to persuade Trump to take two things seriously in his role as president. First, that the role of the free press is to hold the powerful to account. And second, that President Trump's attacks on the news media have dangerous consequences, both at home and around the world. In a remarkable new exchange, the publisher of the New York Times pressed Trump at length on both these points. The results were startling. Trump displayed only the dimmest awareness that his attacks on the press might be having severely negative effects, while repeatedly reverting into a tone that alternated between megalomaniacal self-congratulation and self-imagined victimization, and largely refusing to accept responsibility for those consequences.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

First, Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger tells Trump that his attacks on the press are resonating ""globally, on every continent."" Then this happens: SULZBERGER: As I've talked to my colleagues around the globe … particularly working in countries where a free press is an already tenuous thing, they say that they are increasingly of the belief that your rhetoric is creating a climate in which dictators and tyrants are able to employ your words in suppressing the free press … TRUMP: Would you say more so now than over the last five years?	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

I mean, more so now than even a year ago? SULZBERGER: Yes. And I think — TRUMP: I'm not happy to hear that. Trump seems dimly curious about the global impact of his rhetoric, and allows that he is ""not happy"" to hear that dictators and tyrants are employing it to suppress the free press. That's a start, right? Sort of. Then comes this: SULZBERGER: The United States and the occupants of your office have historically been the greatest defenders of the free press, and — TRUMP: And I think I am, too. I want to be.

So he describes himself as a great defender of the free press, before catching himself and remembering that he should make his defense conditional. Sulzberger presses Trump directly on whether he is ""aware of these broad consequences"" that his attacks on the press are having around the world. Trump questions this premise, then continues: TRUMP: I do notice that people are declaring more and more fake news. ... I even see it in other countries. I don't necessarily attribute that to me.

He does display a moment of modesty, in declining to take credit for the global use of the phrase ""fake news,"" before praising himself for inventing it. Then Sulzberger presses harder on the consequences this is having: SULZBERGER: The phrase ""fake news,"" you're exactly right, it has been embraced globally. And several countries have actually banned fake news. But it was a technique to actually ban an independent media. ...	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

I do think it's very bad for a country when the news is not accurately portrayed. A bit later, Trump explains the sort of inaccurate coverage that troubles him. ""I do believe I'm a victim of that, honestly,"" he says. ""I don't know why. Because I really think I'm doing a great job."" So once again, Trump grudgingly suggests it might be a problem that his powerful branding has been used to suppress independent media, before slipping right back into claiming that the real problem is … fake news.

And it comes with scrutiny and questions. ... TRUMP: I don't mind a bad story if it's true. … I've had bad stories — very bad stories — where I thought it was true. And I would never complain. But when you get really bad stories where it's not true, then you sort of say, ""that's unfair."" If Trump thinks a bad story about him is true, then he's fine with that story. It's just that most of the bad stories about him aren't true, and he gets to say whether any given story is true or not.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

What do you think the press does?"" ""It describes and should describe accurately what's going on,"" Trump replies, adding that accurate and fair news coverage is ""a very, very important and beautiful thing."" And what might that look like? A bit later, he reveals what's been nagging at him all along: TRUMP: I came from Jamaica, Queens, Jamaica Estates, and I became president of the United States.

A few months ago, Fox's Chris Wallace pushed Trump at length on these matters, and he similarly declared that he's perfectly happy to accept negative news coverage of himself, provided it's accurate, while also essentially asserting that only he gets to say when negative coverage actually is accurate, which is rarely to never.	8	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

We in the news media often whack politicians for not being serious about policy. And then we ignore their policy proposals. So here, in the spirit of orgiastic wonkishness, is my Dummy’s Guide to Democratic Policy Proposals. I write it because something fascinating is underway: After decades of incrementalism, Democrats are now proposing a litany of exciting big ideas. Here’s my take: Child allowances are among the best ideas to boost America’s future. They are used very successfully abroad to reduce child poverty. One proposal would give families with children $250 to $300 per month, in the form of a refundable tax credit. Luke Shaefer of the University of Michigan estimates that this would reduce the number of children living in poverty by more than one-third.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The idea is that every child would get a $1,000 savings account at birth, and then children in low-income households would get an additional $2,000 deposit in the account each year. At age 18, the person would get control over the account — which at this point could be worth almost $50,000, including interest — but it could be used only for wealth-building purposes, such as education, a down payment on a home or possibly starting a business.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-03-27	New York Times (Online)	A Dummy’s Guide to Democratic Policy Proposals	txt-opeds/2198123985.xml.txt	Such accounts have been rigorously studied since the 1990s and have been remarkably successful at helping people gain financial success, often as entrepreneurs. As Robert E. Friedman wrote in his excellent recent book on such accounts, “A Few Thousand Dollars,” the accounts increase homeownership, education and business start-ups (they work best when paired with financial literacy training and savings matches). A plus: Baby bonds would reduce most of the racial wealth gap in the U.S. Child care for at-risk kids is one of the highest-return investments we can make. Senator Elizabeth Warren has proposed a high-quality child care program that resembles the U.S. military’s outstanding program, paid for on a sliding scale depending on the parents’ income.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-03-27	New York Times (Online)	A Dummy’s Guide to Democratic Policy Proposals	txt-opeds/2198123985.xml.txt	The focus of Warren’s program is helping parents find child care while they work, and that’s important. The United States was a world leader in helping women get into the labor force, but we have lagged the last couple of decades. For prime-age women, we now rank 30th out of 35 advanced countries in female labor force participation — partly because of child care challenges. But while the economic gains are potentially enormous, the even more important reason is to put at-risk low-income children on a path to success. Research suggests that investments in early childhood, especially for kids in dysfunctional homes, are perhaps the best investments this country could make.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Warren’s proposed wealth tax is also intriguing. It has been tried in Europe and failed, but it may be more workable in a larger country like the United States that people are less likely to cut ties with. It’s true that the wealth tax would be a challenge for paper billionaires with illiquid private companies. But we already have a wealth tax — the property tax — that hurts low-income widows. If impoverished widows can manage, so can billionaires. I suggest testing at a 1 percent rate for billionaires.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Rent control typically backfires by reducing supply and compounding shortages. Legislation that would make companies pay a tax equivalent to the food stamps and school lunch subsidies employees receive would lead companies to avoid hiring people in low-income households, particularly those with children. There are also many more good ideas, including vigorous antitrust enforcement to break up semi-monopolies, an expanded earned-income tax credit and other job initiatives, plus universal health insurance (though multi-payer has worked well in countries like Germany, so no need to be dogmatic about single-payer). These policy proposals don’t have the drama of a denunciation by President Trump of his rivals, but they could help reshape America.

We're watching a realization by progressive Democrats that they may have passed their zenith and are facing the downhill slope of power.

Many of these ideas scored well in public opinion polls. When it comes to wielding power, though, the only polls that matter are the ones on Election Day. The results were emphatic.

Biden's legacy, they purr, could be the greatest since Franklin D. Roosevelt's. But Roosevelt did not become the most successful Democratic politician of modern times by holding popular bills hostage to unpopular ones. Today's progressives misunderstand FDR and his New Deal, and they would have a more promising future if they were to study the example more closely. Some of the most ambitious progressive legislation of the New Deal — for example, Social Security and the pro-union Wagner Act — did not pass Congress in 1933, immediately after Roosevelt won his first presidential election. These laws passed two years later, after Democrats picked up seats in the midterm election. FDR allowed the public to deliver its verdict on his governing approach.

Some of the extra money would be borrowed, but most of it — $3.6 trillion — is supposed to come from new revenues.

Most of the money is supposed to come from closing loopholes and eliminating perceived inequities — things like giving the I.R.S. the resources to crack down on wealthy tax cheats, eliminating rules that allow many capital gains to go completely untaxed and closing off some of the major avenues for corporate tax avoidance.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Could it be done more effectively? My answer is yes to the first two questions, if you assume — as I think we should — that given the political realities Biden needs to keep his ambitions fairly modest. The answer to the third is, it’s complicated. There are, as I see it, three main critiques of Biden’s tax approach, two of which deserve to be taken seriously. The unserious critique is the claim that raising taxes on corporations and high incomes would cripple the economy. Assertions that prosperity depends on keeping taxes at the top low have been refuted by experience time and time again — most recently in the failure of the Trump tax cuts to deliver the promised immense investment boom.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

So let’s not waste time on it. A far more serious critique of Biden’s approach comes from the left. There’s a good case that the kind of society progressives want us to become, with a very strong social safety net, can’t be paid for just by taxing the rich. A country like Denmark, for example, does have a high top tax rate (although it’s not that much higher than the effective tax rate facing high-income New Yorkers, who pay state and city as well as federal taxes). But Denmark also has very high middle-class taxation, in particular a 25 percent value-added tax, effectively a national sales tax.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

So if you want Medicare for all, Nordic levels of support for child care and families in general, and so on, just raising taxes on the 400K-plus elite won’t get you there.

Surely it makes sense to pursue a more modest agenda, one that would still make a huge difference to American lives but that could be financed by raising taxes only on corporations and the wealthy. But what form should those tax increases take? There are many interesting, smart ideas out there — for example, Elizabeth Warren’s proposed wealth tax — that didn’t make it into the Biden plan.

Given that the U.S. government can borrow at negative real interest rates, however, this isn’t a big concern. So what is Biden doing wrong? Honestly, I can’t tell. I like to think that I know a fair bit of economics and can recognize the difference between real experts and hacks.

He warns of a long-term trend toward ever-concentrated wealth and urges a global wealth tax to prevent it. While that might be a bad idea even if it were politically feasible, there is merit to the broader notion that industrialized countries could better coordinate taxing wealth, corporate and otherwise, that flits around the world in search of the lowest rates. Case in point: U.S. drug maker Pfizer's $106 billion offer for Britain's AstraZeneca, which could enable Pfizer to flag itself as a British company and pay taxes at Britain's 20 percent rate rather than this country's 35 percent.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Both sides have a point. What's needed is a system for a world in which other countries have slashed their rates below U.S. levels and in which firms increasingly hold capital in forms that can easily be assigned to overseas subsidiaries, such as intellectual property. It's an urgent issue, because U.S. firms hold$2 trillion in cash abroad rather than in the United States, where it could be invested -- and taxed at higher U.S. rates.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

On the Republican side, Rep. Dave Camp, the retiring chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, offered a plan this year that would have cut the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, the developed-nation average, and subject foreign profits to a one-shot tax and exempt them from U.S. taxes thereafter, in line with the practice of most other industrial countries. While neither plan matches the other or Mr. Piketty's idea, they at least share common elements: an effort to close loopholes so that the government raises the same revenue even at a lower tax rate, an attempt to harmonize U.S. and foreign tax rules to discourage international rate-shopping and a sense that tax policy should support job-creating investment, not the rent-seeking against which Mr. Piketty appropriately warns.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

That's the logic behind coordinated moves in progressive states to tax wealth. The reforms aren't likely to pass immediately, but they illustrate the increasingly open socialist goals of progressives and their public-union backers. The confiscatory tax alliance emerged late last week when lawmakers from eight states unveiled plans to target wealthy residents. California, New York, Illinois, Maryland, Hawaii, Minnesota, Connecticut and Washington state are all represented, and several of the sponsors have already released bills.

Some resemble Sen. Elizabeth Warren's outline from 2021 and would cut out a slice from large asset holdings each year regardless of whether they grew in value. That includes California, which would take 1% a year from households worth more than $50 million and 1.5% from those worth more than $1 billion. This is a grab for the fortunes of tech entrepreneurs who have already filled Sacramento's coffers with payments on income and capital gains. The California bill would also require taxpayers with illiquid assets to file yearly reports on their holdings and eventually pay the tax, even if they move out of state. Communist China doesn't even do that. The Eagles were ahead of their time when they wrote ""Hotel California"": You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The targets would have to pay the levy whether or not they sold the assets being taxed, though the author hasn't mentioned a comparable deduction for capital losses. ""We want to send a message that there is nowhere to hide,"" state Rep. Will Guzzardi told the press last week about the interstate effort. Illinois Democrats must still be fuming over the departure of hedge-fund founder Ken Griffin last year, along with his $200 million in annual state taxes. Other wealth-tax proposals, such as New York's, are better described as mega-surtaxes. State Sen. Gustavo Rivera introduced a bill to increase the state's 10.9% top capital-gains tax rate, adding 7.5 percentage points for households earning more than $550,000 and another 7.5 points for those above $1.1 million. Including federal levies, this means politicians would take half of every dollar in investment earnings. You take all the risk, the politicians get half the gain.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

As usual, public unions are pushing the progressive lawmakers they fund to tap new streams of tax revenue so they can get bigger salaries and pensions. These are all awful ideas—anti-growth and ruinous for the incentive to work, invest and take risks. The taxes are also difficult to calculate since the value of nonfinancial assets may not have an active market.

This Arizonan wants you to think he’s trying to “Make America Great Again.” But he’s not a nationalist. He’s not just about building a wall. He wants to build a new world — one where nations are obsolete. Masters is a protege and pawn of PayPal’s co-founder and Silicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel, who has bragged about participating in “the erosion of the nation-state.” Jean Guerrero is the author, most recently, of “Hatemonger: Stephen Miller, Donald Trump and the White Nationalist Agenda.” A 35-year-old crypto evangelist, Masters is cribbing the nativist script to convince you he’ll stop the so-called border “invasion.” He even touts slashing legal immigration in half.

Masters parrots their hateful rhetoric about Democrats changing U.S. demographics: “It’s about a small group of elites who want to destroy this country,” he said. Fox News host Tucker Carlson calls him the GOP’s “future.” A spokeswoman for Masters declined to comment for this article. Masters’ nativism is a Trojan horse for something more ominous: a world where literally nobody has a voice except a small group of elites with all-seeing, all-powerful technology. Thiel put more than $13 million into Masters’ campaign. He’s also backing Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance and helped Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley win in 2018.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It’s not hard to figure out what a Masters victory could mean. Thiel wrote in 2009: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” He has also revealed the book that most shaped him: 1997’s “The Sovereign Individual” by James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg. The book prophesied the collapse of nation-states. The authors depict this as an exciting future for elites freed of regulation, interacting “on terms that echo the relation among the gods in Greek myth.” Elites control everything, hiring private militias as the rest of us descend into destitution and random violence.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

(See: mass migration.) Glen Weyl, a leading thinker in the Web3 community who has criticized the authors’ predictions through his think tank RadicalxChange, believes Masters’ xenophobic rhetoric is a tool Thiel is using to fast-forward to the book’s dystopia. From the Senate, wannabe god-kings can accelerate the nation-state’s decline by promoting digital extremism, tax loopholes and bitcoin maximalism. “The strategy these guys follow is to do a lot of rabble-rousing and to look really right-wing,” Weyl told me, “and to then get the mainstream media to hate on them for being right-wing, and to use that to bring these far-right people close to them.”	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

In the meeting, Weyl recalls Thiel saying: “You sound like a threat to my position. How seriously should I take that threat?” Weyl believes Thiel felt threatened by Weyl’s tech-forward wealth tax proposal in his book “Radical Markets.” Thiel didn’t respond to my requests for comment. Max Chafkin, author of the well-regarded Thiel biography “The Contrarian,” described Masters to me as “an extension of Thiel.” He believes Thiel is motivated by hunger for money and power.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Masters became friendly with Steve Bannon, who was convicted Friday of contempt of Congress for withholding information about the Jan. 6 coup attempt.

Ms. Warren is proposing a transformation of American government, business and life that exceeds what the socialist dreamers of a century ago imagined. Her standing in the polls has fallen after missteps over Medicare, but she is still in the top candidate tier.

Courts might also find the tax unconstitutional. • Medicare for All tax: Charge companies with at least 50 workers an ""Employer Medicare Contribution,"" equal to 98% of their recent outlays on health care, while adjusting for inflation and changes in staff size. These varying fees ""would be gradually shifted to converge at the average health care cost-per-employee nationally."" Estimated revenue: $8.8 trillion over a decade. If receipts fall short, add a ""supplemental"" tax on ""big companies with extremely high executive compensation and stock buyback rates."" • Global corporate tax: Raise the top business rate to 35%. Apply this as a world-wide minimum on overseas earnings by U.S. companies. Businesses would ""pay the difference between the minimum tax and the rate in the countries where they book their profits."" Apply a similar minimum tax to foreign companies, prorated by the share of their sales made in the U.S. Estimated revenue: $1.65 trillion over a decade.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

This would go atop the regular corporate rate. Estimated revenue: $1 trillion over a decade from 1,200 public companies. • Slower expensing: ""Our current tax system lets companies deduct the cost of certain investments they make in assets faster than those assets actually lose value."" Closing this ""loophole,"" she says, would raise $1.25 trillion over a decade. • Higher capital gains taxes : Tax the investment gains of the wealthiest 1% as ordinary income, meaning rates near 40% instead of today's 23.8%.

Establish a matching 14.8% surcharge on net investment income, paid by those earning more than $250,000. • Lobbying tax: Tax ""excessive lobbying"" over $500,000 a year at rates up to 75%. Ms. Warren says this would have raised $10 billion over the past decade, although it probably runs headlong into the First Amendment's right to petition the government. Use the revenue for ""a surge of resources to Congress and federal agencies."" • Medicare for All: Mandate government coverage for everyone, including for illegal immigrants, with no copays or deductibles. Phase out the private plans of 170 million Americans. She says this would cost $20.5 trillion over a decade, which most economists say is $10 trillion short of reality.

Now Oklahoma is rewarding its citizens by cutting taxes to make the state more competitive. Republicans control the House, Senate and governorship in the Sooner State, and last week Gov. Kevin Stitt signed the tax bills into law. Effective Jan. 1, the corporate income tax will drop to 4% from 6%, and the legislation also cuts individual income tax rates across the board by 0.25 percentage points. The top rate falls to 4.75%.

The state had projected a $1.4 billion revenue decline in the dark days of spring 2020 but began its 2021 legislative session with a $1.6 billion surplus. ""It was the perfect time to institute some tax relief,"" says Mr. McCall. The new rates mean Oklahoma will now rank sixth lowest among states that assess personal income tax and tied with Missouri as second lowest among states with a corporate income tax, according to the Tax Foundation.

One of the ways he has proposed to pay for these programs is through changing the way capital gains are taxed. These reforms aren't just about raising money, they are about fundamentally reforming the tax system to ensure the wealthy pay their fair share. President Biden has proposed changing the way property is taxed when it is passed on to heirs. Right now, when you sell a piece of property, you pay tax on the amount it increased in value since you purchased it. If you pass it on to an heir, that heir is treated as though they bought that property the day you died, so if they sell, they pay tax only on the increase in value during the time that they held the property.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Millionaires and billionaires borrow against their assets, usually stock or real estate, but also art and collectibles, really anything a bank will lend against. When those assets are transferred upon death, their heirs can sell the property without being taxed to pay off the debt. This is one of the most popular ways the rich avoid taxation, and it must end. Folks ask me, what about farmers? Won't this mean they have to sell the farm to pay the tax? No, because President Biden's proposal includes special protections for family-owned business, including family farms. Under the proposal there are two key protections for farmers. First, if a farmer is passing along the farm to his or her children so that they can keep the farm going, no tax is due until they decide to stop farming or sell the farm. That is true for all other family businesses too.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

So even if a farmer's heirs decide to sell the farm, they only pay tax on any gain above that exemption. The $2.5 million exemption means that more than 95% of families won't face any new tax. When I was a practicing lawyer, I represented a client who owned a few thousand acres of land. Rather than pay me in cash for my work, he paid me with 600 acres of his land. In the early 1990s my land was worth $191,000. I paid taxes on that income then, as I did on all other income from my practice that year. I'm no farmer, I'm a lawyer and a public servant, but my wife and I decided to keep that land. Now it is worth almost $2 million.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

If your candidate is still back in the pack, don't worry. That's right — history is on your side, as well. The Des Moines Register reminds us: In caucus cycles since 2004, only three candidates who were first in the November Iowa Poll — [Bill] Clinton, [Barack] Obama and Mike Huckabee — won their party's caucus a few months later. The three other candidates who went on to win the caucus had not yet captured the lead in November, and sometimes trailed by large margins.

If you, as I did, seemed to remember really late surges, you might be surprised that the only one matching that description was Howard Dean, the former Vermont governor, who popped up in January 2004. In other words, if a candidate isn't on the upswing now or by next month, the caucuses are unlikely to go well for them in February.

As for Iowa voters, Buttigieg seems to be hitting a sweet spot and garnering big crowds and favorable local coverage. If we don't see someone else break through in December, he could come in well ahead of some much better-known candidates. For Biden, voters may want to know, Is he sharp enough? His core group of supporters hasn't lost confidence, but he is having trouble satisfying skeptics, so his numbers are not increasing as yet.

Her implementation plan did not do much to calm nervous voters who want, more than anything, to beat President Trump.

Voters there might well give her a first-round caucus vote to see if she can get over the 15-percent hump, and if she doesn't, then decamp to another candidate for the second and final round. Showing these voters that she is pulling in big money and moving in polls — projecting confidence and progress — may be more critical for Klobuchar than for any other candidate. There's one more candidate who I would not count out until we get through December: Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). Voters may ask, Do I now understand who she is? Her ups and downs in the polls may have scared off voters who want to go with someone who can win, but along the way (judging from the Liberty and Justice dinner in Iowa and the most recent debate), she finally hit her stride, giving impassioned and confident performances that show her deep concern about some core issues. Voters who appreciate her rhetorical panache may be rooting for a general-election debate in which she pummels Trump.

In a 2014 Times piece, Brown University administrator Ted Widmer , among other things, the fate of humans within the American ecosystem: The war may have begun haltingly, but it soon became total, and in certain instances, a war upon civilians and the countryside as well as upon the opposing forces. Gen. William T. Sherman famously explained that he wanted the people of the South to feel ''the hard hand of war,'' and he cut a wide swath on his march to the sea in November and December 1864. ''We devoured the land,'' he wrote in a letter to his wife.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Philip H. Sheridan pursued a similar scorched-earth campaign in the Shenandoah Valley in September and October 1864, burning farms and factories and anything else that might be useful to the Confederates. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant told him to ''eat out Virginia clear and clear as far as they go, so that crows flying over it for the balance of the season will have to carry their provender with them.'' Other flying creatures found their provender easily enough, according to Mr. Widmer: Insects thrived in the camps, in part because the armies destroyed the forest habitats of the birds, bats and other predators that would keep pest populations down. Mosquitoes carried out their own form of aerial attack upon unsuspecting men from both sides. More than 1.3 million soldiers in the Union alone were affected by mosquito-borne illnesses like malaria and yellow fever. An Ohio private. Isaac Jackson, wrote, ''the skeeters here are -- well, there is no use talking ... I never seen the like.'' Flies, ticks, maggots and chiggers added to the misery.	6	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Fetid latrines and impure water bred disease and did more to weaken the ranks than actual warfare. Some 1.6 million Union troops suffered from diarrhea and dysentery; Southern numbers were surely proportional. Rats were abundantly present on both sides, carrying germs and eating their way through any food they could find. Probably the worst places of all were the prisoner camps. A Massachusetts private, Amos Stearns, wrote a two-line poem from his confinement in South Carolina: ''A Confederate prison is the place/Where hunting for lice is no disgrace.'' Some Alabama prisoners in a New York prison made a stew of the prison's rat population. (''They taste very much like a young squirrel,'' wrote Lt. Edmund D. Patterson.)	7	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Warren has never suffered as captured soldiers did in that era, so perhaps she has not considered the price already paid. The American Battlefield Trust notes that available records of wounded soldiers did not include the full impact of the national trauma on those who survived: Our modern conception of casualties includes those who have been psychologically damaged by warfare. This distinction did not exist during the Civil War. Soldiers suffering from what we would now recognize as post-traumatic stress disorder were uncatalogued and uncared for. Approximately one in four soldiers that went to war never returned home. At the outset of the war, neither army had mechanisms in place to handle the amount of death that the nation was about to experience.

Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) presidential campaign, you know she has a series of ambitious plans, many of which involve substantial government spending. Since she's a Democrat, she has to say where she'll get the money (an obligation that, for some reason, Republicans are relieved of), and she claims that she'll do it largely via a wealth tax. In her plan, assets over $50 million would be taxed at 2 percent per year, and assets over $1 billion would be taxed at 3 percent. She calculates it would raise $275 billion a year, which could be used for all kinds of wonderful things such as universal pre-K, eliminating college debt and boosting affordable housing.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

But there is another argument against a wealth tax, which is laid out in an article in The Post: Warren's ambitious agenda relies on two assumptions that defy a long history of U.S. policymaking: First, that the country's wealthiest taxpayers won't find ways to evade the targeted tax hike she proposes; and second, that new entitlement programs won't result in ballooning costs that plunge the federal government deeper into debt. ""She's gone big. There's nothing small about these proposals,"" said Mark Zandi, who, as chief economist at Moody's Analytics, has analyzed policies for Warren and other presidential candidates. ""Will the wealthy do things that wealthy people can do to avoid paying the tax? That's the real concern that I have. . . . A lot of other countries have tried this and backtracked because of tax avoidance issues.""	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

They also tend to think that there's something fundamentally unfair about the very idea of paying into the system that makes their wealth possible. Look no further than our current president, who may be one of the great tax cheats in American history. As the New York Times exhaustively documented, Donald Trump, his father, and his siblings engaged in a massive tax-fraud scheme during the 1980s and 1990s, which enabled them to cheat the government out of hundreds of millions of dollars.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

And, of course, in 2016, when Hillary Clinton alleged that Trump might not be paying any taxes, he responded, ""That makes me smart."" So yes, wealthy people have the means, motive and opportunity to avoid paying a wealth tax. So what should we do about it? Warren says that she wants to beef up Internal revenue Service enforcement to make cheating more difficult. But there's no doubt that it's a real problem, particularly since hiding wealth can be easier than hiding income. Even some liberal economists have warned that cheating would be rampant if a wealth tax was in place.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-05-22	The Washington Post (Online)	To make her wealth tax work, Elizabeth Warren must revive the IRS	txt-opeds/2229001095.xml.txt	That leaves you with a few options. You can scrap it and try something else; you can just accept that there will be lots of cheating, but use a wealth tax anyway to get whatever revenue you can; or you can put it in place and massively increase enforcement. Like, massively — by hiring thousands of new IRS agents, giving them the resources they need, and imposing serious penalties for those who cheat. Start sending billionaires to San Quentin and the rest of them might decide it isn't worth the risk. Unfortunately, in recent years, we've been moving in the other direction. As ProPublica has documented, Republicans have waged a highly successful war on the IRS budget that has yielded results, including letting tax cheats off the hook and leaving billions of dollars in lost revenue every year: As of last year, the IRS had 9,510 auditors. That's down a third from 2010. The last time the IRS had fewer than 10,000 revenue agents was 1953, when the economy was a seventh of its current size. And the IRS is still shrinking. Almost a third of its remaining employees will be eligible to retire in the next year, and with morale plummeting, many of them will.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

But even those stark numbers don't tell the whole story, say current and former IRS employees: Auditors are stretched thin, and they're often forced to limit their investigations and move on to the next audit as quickly as they can. Which means that a huge increase in funding for the IRS will be necessary if we're going to have a fair tax system. Because a fair system is one not only where people are asked to pay their fair share, but where it's difficult for them to just decide they won't.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) released her spending plan to finance Medicare-for-all, a single-payer health-care scheme that would eliminate private insurance. The Post reports: The plan is designed to hit corporations and the wealthy, including a provision requiring companies to send most of the funds they currently spend on employee health contributions to the federal government. It also expands Warren's signature wealth tax proposal, cuts military spending and takes advantage of what she says would be significant savings from eliminating private insurance's vast bureaucracy. ... The proposal comes on top of roughly $5 trillion in new taxes that Warren had already advocated to cover a range of new programs, including through a levy on those with more than $50 million in assets. It doubles down on Warren's strategy of winning the Democratic nomination by consolidating support from the party's liberal wing, rather than reaching out to more centrist Democrats.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Even Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) concedes it would cost $30 trillion or more. Perhaps voters' eyes will glaze over, and they will decide that everyone can find an economist to justify anything, but others might see the sort of standard sleight of hand — trillions in administrative savings! stronger tax enforcement! — as confirmation that it really is impossible to come up with a plan this extensive and not further burden the middle class.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

""Warren's new numbers are simply not believable, and have been contradicted by experts. Regardless of whether it's $21 trillion or $31 trillion, this isn't going to happen, and the American people need health care."" Second, there is not much of a justification as to why we need this when Affordable Care Act premiums are decreasing and other issues (e.g. extending coverage, premium costs) can be addressed through much cheaper proposals, such as the public option.

An $800 billion cut in defense? What's the justification for that, and what national security concerns does it raise? What moderate Democrat is going to sign on to this? The bigger and more complicated it is, the more obvious it becomes a fantasy — one that could prevent more modest and achievable ends such as prescription drug cost containment. Warren is relying, for example, on a wholesale immigration reform plan (something that frankly does not seem politically attainable) to generate hundreds of billions of dollars (above and beyond revenue going to state and local governments).

The New York Times reports: ""Ms. Warren's plan would put substantial downward pressure on payments to hospitals, doctors and pharmaceutical companies. ... Payments to hospitals would be 10 percent higher on average than what Medicare pays now, a rate that would make some hospitals whole but would lead to big reductions for others. She would reduce doctors' pay to the prices Medicare pays now, with additional reductions for specialists, and small increases to doctors who provide primary care.""

The Times observes: ""Although she is not proposing broad tax increases on individuals, her proposal will still allow Republicans to portray her as a tax-and-spend liberal who wants to dramatically expand the role of the federal government while abolishing private health insurance. Her plan's $20.5 trillion price tag is equal to roughly one-third of what the federal government is currently projected to spend over the next decade in total.""

Andy Slavitt, who headed the Medicare and Medicaid trust funds under President Barack Obama, tells me: ""In my view, 90 percent of the Democratic focus on health care should be on Trump's lawsuit and his other plans to get rid of the ACA and pre-existing condition protections."" He suggests, ""The other 10 percent can be on policy differences between the candidates on how they would ideally make universal coverage happen.""

This embodies one of the major criticisms of the super-progressive wing of the Democratic Party: blind faith in centralized federal government with little or no regard for unintended consequences. Eighth, the plan does damage to her brand. Warren's plan is a reminder of how far to the left of the rest of the field she really is. The notion that she is a ""compromise"" between Sanders and center-left candidates will be harder to sustain. Moreover, she was supposed to be the straight-shooter, the candid progressive who could tip the scales in favor of working-class Americans. There are plenty of voters (including more moderate African American voters with whom she has struggled to connect) who might regard this as akin to Trump's magical health-care plan (better! cheaper!) or other snake oil peddled by politicians.

Musk said on Twitter that he does not take compensation from Tesla or his other companies via a cash salary or cash bonus. “I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock,” he tweeted. As of June 30, Musk was reported to own 244 million shares of Tesla, or about 23% of its stock. That includes 73.5 million shares Musk is due from exercising 2012 stock options that expire at the end of August 2022. The common estimation of Musk’s wealth is largely dependent on the price of Tesla shares, which were trading at about $1,181 as these words were being written.

More than 88 million of those shares are pledged as collateral on debts Musk has accumulated, according to Tesla’s 2021 proxy statement. That’s a clue to how the ultrawealthy avoid paying more than a pittance of tax on their wealth: They borrow against it to cover living expenses. Loans like those aren’t reportable as taxable income, so it’s free and clear. Rich stockholders can wait to sell until conditions are most advantageous.

For one thing, Tesla shares are riding at record levels just now, so it might make sense for him to cash out at least some of them while the getting is good. Further, he actually does face what looks like an inescapable tax bill next year, when Musk exercises the options on 73.5 million shares. At current prices, Musk’s gain on the exercise would come to more than $20 billion. At the top federal and California income tax rates, or 54.1%, he would owe about $11 billion. Selling 10% of even the 170.5 million shares he has in hand now, pre-exercise, would bring him more than $20 billion, more than enough to cover the looming tax bill and perhaps even to pay down some of his existing debt.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It’s not every week that the national discourse catches fire over tax policy. The match, of course, was the investigation ProPublica published on Tuesday of anonymously leaked tax documents that revealed that the 25 richest Americans — billionaires such as Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk and Warren Buffett — pay very little in taxes to the federal government relative to their astronomical wealth. In some years, they paid nothing at all.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-10	New York Times (Online)	Why Elon Musk Has a Lower Tax Rate Than You	txt-opeds/2539662866.xml.txt	Depending on your point of view, it was either one of the most important stories of the year or an invented scandal. Here’s a closer look at the report and what people are saying about it. Inside the report In recent years, ProPublica noted, the median American household made $70,000 in annual income and paid about 14 percent in federal income taxes. The highest marginal tax rate, 37 percent, kicked in this year, for couples, on income above $628,300. But the report showed the ultrarich pay just a fraction of that rate: Most Americans make money by working a job and earning a salary, and only a small portion of that income can be channeled into investments — stock or housing, say — that might yield a profit.The ultrarich, on the other hand, make a vast majority of their money from assets. In Bezos’s case, his wealth increased by $99 billion between 2014 and 2018, but he reported a total of only $4.22 billion in income. As a result, he paid just $973 million in income taxes — a 1.1 percent “true tax rate” on the rise in his fortune. ProPublica estimated that the top 25 richest people collectively paid a true tax rate of only 3.4 percent during those years.Even looking strictly at what the top 25 richest people reported as their income, ProPublica found that they paid about just 16 percent to the government between 2014 and 2018. That’s because the ultrarich have perfectly legal strategies of lowering their income tax liability, like using business credits and deducting interest expenses on debt. The results can be perverse: In 2011, Bezos, then worth $18 billion, filed a tax return reporting he made so little because of investment losses that he received a $4,000 child tax credit.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

A scandal that wasn’t? Many critics of the ProPublica story took issue with its “true tax rate” metric, which The Wall Street Journal editorial board called “a phony construct that exists nowhere in the law.” There is a reason wealth isn’t taxed like income, as the ProPublica report itself noted: In 1920, seven years after the 16th Amendment was ratified, giving the federal government the power to tax income, the Supreme Court considered the case of a woman named Myrtle Macomber, who owed taxes under the new law on a stock dividend. But she hadn’t received any money — just more shares of the stock.The court ruled that this wealth couldn’t be treated as income. It could be taxed only if and when the underlying assets were sold, or “realized.” This distinction has persisted ever since. Today, when assets are sold or pay cash dividends, the gains are taxed at no more than 23.8 percent.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

2021-06-10	New York Times (Online)	Why Elon Musk Has a Lower Tax Rate Than You	txt-opeds/2539662866.xml.txt	Why has the tax system allowed for such runaway inequality? My colleague Binyamin Appelbaum places the blame with the Macomber standard, which he argues rests on false assumptions: The first falsehood is that unrealized gains are unusable. The report shows the wealthy do use their unsold assets, by borrowing against them for spending money: Elon Musk, for example, pledged Tesla stock worth $57.7 billion as collateral for personal loans. Such loans often aren’t repaid until death, a strategy known as “buy, borrow, die.” Until then, payments on the interest can be used to reduce income tax liability.The second falsehood is that people must eventually pay taxes on their wealth, even if that doesn’t happen until their death. But the wealthy have strategies to avoid even this final taxation. One is a loophole known as step-up in basis: When an appreciated asset is bequeathed, its value is reset, or stepped up, in the eyes of the law, allowing inheritors to bypass billions in capital gains taxes. Another strategy is to pass down assets through complicated trusts and philanthropies, allowing the rich to avoid taxes on almost half of their estate value.The third falsehood is that taxing wealth is simply too impractical for the government to do. But as Appelbaum notes, the government manages to collect property taxes, which is a kind of wealth tax, just fine.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

But as Appelbaum notes, the government manages to collect property taxes, which is a kind of wealth tax, just fine. So what should change? There is no shortage of ideas about how to rein in wealth inequality. Tax wealth: The Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman have put forward several proposals for directly taxing wealth, including a relatively modest 3 percent tax on fortunes over $1 billion, which would merely slow the rate of their growth, and a more aggressive 10 percent tax, which would gradually shrink them.	8	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2021-06-10	New York Times (Online)	Why Elon Musk Has a Lower Tax Rate Than You	txt-opeds/2539662866.xml.txt	The politics of this kind of tax, though, are difficult: Even if a direct wealth tax managed to pass, there would almost certainly be a constitutional challenge. Less constitutionally fraught is a proposal from Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, to tax unrealized gains, which account for a majority of billionaires’ wealth. Wyden’s proposal would tax these unrealized gains every year, and at the same rate as income, for Americans who report income above $1 million or assets above $10 million for three years in a row. The logistics of this, too, would be tricky, as Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management, has written for MarketWatch. Would it cause big yearly sell-offs, for example, or lead to tax schemes by which the rich offset their income with unrealized losses?	9	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2021-06-10	New York Times (Online)	Why Elon Musk Has a Lower Tax Rate Than You	txt-opeds/2539662866.xml.txt	Zucman and Saez recently proposed a potential, if temporary, way around this pitfall: a one-time income tax on the totality of every billionaire’s unrealized gains, which they say would raise approximately $1 trillion. Fix the estate tax: President Joe Biden has proposed a tax plan that would close the step-up in basis loophole that allows for the seamless intergenerational transfer of wealth. Doing so could raise $113 billion over a decade, according to an analysis from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Raise corporate and capital gains taxes: Biden’s plan would raise the corporate tax rate, from 21 percent to 28 percent, and crack down on companies that avoid this tax by shifting profits abroad. The Times editorial board wrote in favor of this idea in April, though some progressive economists say it doesn’t go far enough.	10	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-10	New York Times (Online)	Why Elon Musk Has a Lower Tax Rate Than You	txt-opeds/2539662866.xml.txt	Biden’s plan would also tax capital gains at the same rate as income. This would effectively close what DealBook calls “one of the most egregious and persistent loopholes” in the tax code, which allows investment managers to pay less in taxes by treating their pay as capital gains rather than income. Make income tax records public: In the 1860s and 1920s, income tax data was made publicly available, just as local governments now disclose property tax records. “It’s time for another revival,” Appelbaum wrote in 2019. The bottom line As my colleague David Leonhardt writes, the current tax system does not derive from a law of nature. “While some tax avoidance is inevitable,” he says, “the federal government has largely succeeded in raising taxes when it has tried.”	11	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But there is a much closer relationship between the Washington meltdown and the campaign than you might think. You also hear a lot about Democrats veering left. This, too, misses the point. What we're actually seeing is a shift in the intellectual energy of American politics. This is the lesson of the disarray in the Republican Party, and the ultimate capitulation of President Trump in the shutdown fight he initiated. Trump's decision to close the government in the vain pursuit of an essentially meaningless goal showed a party and ideological movement lost in the wilderness.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Traditional conservative nostrums of tax cuts for the best-off and business-friendly deregulation were not answering the needs of less affluent Republicans. Frustrated, they embraced Trump's nationalism and protectionism along with, in many cases, his racialized appeals. They also noticed that Trump defended key social-insurance programs, especially Social Security and Medicare, which serve an aging Republican base. In practice, Trump has stuck resolutely to the old conservatism, with the corporate tax cut being his major achievement. His administration is a coterie of millionaires and billionaires whose insensitivity to the shutdown's victims suggested a worldview inspired by French Bourbons, not prairie populists.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Trump's deteriorating poll numbers showed that all but the most extreme of his supporters were losing faith in his project. In the meantime, liberals and the left have absorbed key lessons from the Trump insurgency. One of them is that a progressive movement seen as speaking primarily for affluent metropolitan areas will never command a durable majority. Another is that there is room for bolder political thinking given the discontent in the country with unevenly shared economic growth.	2	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

These exerted a gravitational pull even on the Barack Obama and Bill Clinton presidencies. Conservatives succeeded in selling the poppycock that showering money on the investing class — the ""makers not the takers,"" the ""job creators"" — would lead to prosperity for all. Influential books were essential to conservatism's rise, and you can see this billionaire-friendly notion now under assault from both moderate progressives (Steve Pearlstein's ""Can American Capitalism Survive? Why Greed Is Not Good, Opportunity Is Not Equal, and Fairness Won't Make Us Poor"") and voices further left (Robert Kuttner's ""Can Democracy Survive Global Capitalism?"").	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and a large middle- and working-class tax cut offered by Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California. Meanwhile, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has inspired serious debate (unimaginable even a few years ago) about a 70 percent tax rate on earnings over $10 million. The underlying assumptions of the right are under assault as well. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) has made ""the dignity of work"" his battle cry, making a case for the priority of labor over capital. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., has called on Democrats to reclaim the concept of ""freedom"" from the right by insisting that, in many areas of everyday life, beginning with civil rights and health care, it takes government action to make freedom a reality.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

The fiscal 2023 budget he unveiled Monday re-proposes most of the bad ideas that haven't passed Congress and adds a new one—a tax on wealth that he refused to endorse as a candidate in 2020. On the economy, he's pivoting further left—presumably to fire up sullen progressives in November. The White House is proposing a new ""billionaire minimum income tax,"" which the Federal Trade Commission would call false advertising if a private company tried that description. The tax isn't limited to billionaires and it applies to more than income.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But these taxpayers already pay a 23.8% tax rate on capital gains and 37% on ordinary income. The average tax rate for the top 1% of taxpayers in 2019 was 25.6%. Here's the Biden trick: The 20% minimum tax rate would apply both to ordinary income and the increase in the value of assets in a given year. This means taxing unrealized capital gains, which currently aren't taxed until assets are sold and income is actually realized. In other words, this is a new tax on wealth—even if it's structured differently than what Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed. The White House is redefining wealth as income.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Going forward they'd have five years to pay the tax on their annual unrealized capital gains. It's not clear whether losses in future years would be allowed to offset annual gains. So a taxpayer might have to pay a tax, say, of $2 million on an unrealized gain in 2022 of $10 million. But if the asset declined by the same $10 million the next year, tough luck. The government would win whether financial and other assets rise or fall.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Non-tradeable assets like a stake in a private company would be assessed at the last valuation event, increased annually at the five-year Treasury rate plus two percentage points or ""other methods approved"" by the Treasury Secretary. The White House proposal would enormously complicate the tax code and create huge investment distortions. ""Illiquid"" taxpayers—defined as those whose tradeable assets make up less than 20% of their wealth—could defer payments until their sale and incur an interest charge. Investors would thus have an incentive to pile into illiquid assets such as real estate to avoid regularly liquidating stock to pay taxes. Rather than sell stock to invest in other ventures, investors might have to sell stock they'd prefer to hold in order to pay taxes on unrealized capital gains.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But if liberals want to encourage capital to flow more freely, they should make the capital-gains rate zero. That's what some countries do. And hasn't the left spent years deploring investor ""short-termism""? Another disingenuous argument is that taxing only realized gains narrows the tax base and requires higher tax rates on income. But the Administration isn't proposing to reduce tax rates. Its budget proposes raising the corporate rate to 28% from 21% and the individual top rate to 39.6%. The wealth tax is intended as an entirely new and additional revenue stream that would rake in close to $360 billion over 10 years.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

But these new taxes always start out applying to a few and then spread to millions. The income tax in 1913 applied a 7% top rate on taxpayers making more than $500,000 ($14.5 million today). The Alternative Minimum Tax was created in 1969 as a flat 10% tax on the uber-rich but grew to cover tens of millions in the middle class. This all assumes the wealth tax would make it past the courts. The Constitution says Congress may only impose ""direct taxes"" if they are apportioned among the states according to their population. The Sixteenth Amendment lets Congress tax income, but unrealized capital gains aren't income any more than unvested stock options are.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

Warren's supporters are understandably angry over how the party's Wall Street wing has recently sharpened its knives against her, especially on her wealth tax. In fact, the wealth tax underscores how much money is concentrated at the very top of our economy. Warren is asking why the wealth of so many middle-class Americans is already taxed (homes are their biggest nest egg, and they pay real estate taxes every year), while the holdings of the very rich often never face a levy. Perhaps her wealth tax will need to be reconfigured in the form of higher taxes on the capital gains, estates and transactions of the most fortunate Americans.

And polls suggest that in South Carolina and Nevada — the states that vote after Iowa and New Hampshire, where Biden is in trouble — the former vice president is hanging on.

Next she swiped at Buttigieg, whom she goaded into pressuring his former employer McKinsey & Co. to allow him to reveal a client list (which turned out to be so squeaky clean as to include the U.S. Postal Service and the Natural Resources Defense Council): Without saying his name, Ms. Warren noted that Mr. Buttigieg ""calls people who raise a quarter-million dollars for him his 'National Investors Circle,' and he offers them regular phone calls and special access.

Buttigieg's communications director Lis Smith responded in writing: ""Senator Warren's idea of how to defeat Donald Trump is to tell people who don't support her that they are unwelcome in the fight and that those who disagree with her belong in the other party.""

In truth, Warren's problem is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has come roaring back from his heart attack and now argues to the far left that he is the only legitimate socialist in the race. (He is right about this.) Warren, not unreasonably, is wary of attacking him for fear of alienating his voters, whom she desperately needs to come over to her side.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

While Warren used to stand out for the plethora of policy position papers, now many candidates have many plans so she no longer stands out. Moreover, the longer her plans stay out there, the less credible they become. The University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, put out a study that confirms criticism of her wealth tax, which Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) dinged in the last debate. CNBC reports that instead of raising $3.75 trillion, her wealth tax would raise between $2.3 trillion and $2.7 trillion: In other words, the study projects the proposed wealth tax will raise $1 trillion to $1.4 trillion less than the Warren campaign advertises.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Worse, the study finds, ""Its findings indicate average hourly wages in the economy, including those earned by households not directly subject to the wealth tax, are projected to fall 0.8% to 2.3% due to the reduction in private capital formation. It also says the tax would shrink the U.S. economy by 0.9% to 2.1% by 2050, depending on how Congress spends the revenues.""	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

However, the record of wealth tax implementation (and repeal) in other countries suggests that Wharton has it pegged. In any event, when a campaign hits the skids, nothing seems to go very well. The Times points out: ""The speech is another example of how, amid stalling poll numbers and a need to recapture the energy that made her this summer's progressive candidate du jour, Ms. Warren is no longer relying on her affirmative message alone to drive supporters into her corner."" Ouch. Warren has time to put it all back together, but she would probably benefit from returning to her positive populist message and showing how she will help the family budgets of the middle class.	6	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Since Nov. 3, however, she has been walking a picket line outside the plant, protesting a contract offer from Donaire’s parent, Rich Products, that comes to a raise of $1.60 an hour over three years — 50 cents an hour in the first year and 55 cents in each of the next two.

The workers have asked for raises of $3 an hour over the life of the contract. Just before Christmas, the company offered a $4.10 hourly increase over three years but would substitute the existing union-sponsored health plan with one workers considered inferior. The employees overwhelmingly voted it down. No further talks are scheduled, according to the union and Buffalo-based Rich Products. The strike has begun to get political support.

The job-gain narrative is competing with the inflation narrative in assessments of the economy, and the inflation narrative is winning.

Part of that trend is an expanding awareness of the working conditions and economic pressures on workers at the low end of the wage spectrum. On Tuesday, for instance, a report by the Economic Roundtable of Los Angeles documented that more than 3 in 4 employees of the grocery conglomerate Krogers met government standards for food insecurity. That means they “cannot afford balanced and healthy food” and “run out of food before the end of the month, skip meals, and are hungry sometimes,” according to the report, which was based on surveys of nearly 37,000 Kroger workers in Southern California, Colorado and the Seattle area.	7	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

About 14% of the surveyed workers said they had resorted to food stamps or a community food bank. The bakery workers union has emerged as an aggressive force for redressing years of declining quality of life for low-wage workers. Over the last year, the union has won contract victories after a nearly five-month strike by 1,400 workers at Kellogg cereal plants, after a nearly five-week strike by 1,000 workers at Mondelez/Nabisco plants and after a 20-day walkout by more than 600 Frito-Lay workers.	8	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

They are not normal times, and workers are just fed up.” The Donaire strike underscores the widening gulf between the corporate suite and the factory floor.

It may be tempting to think of food production as less demanding than quintessentially heavy industries such as automaking. That would be a mistake. The workers are on their feet through their working shift, causing sciatica and other back problems, performing the sort of repetitive tasks that lead to the pains of carpal tunnel syndrome, as the production line on ice cream cakes moves past them at a rate ranging from 13 to 38 cakes a minute. “Fingers hurting, with crampy fingers, arthritis, and back pains — they didn’t care,” striking worker Michele S.

The guest of honor was a long-shot Senate candidate named Barack Obama. Already, Mr. Obama was thinking big. He argued that if Democrats could persuade the American people to make just a slight shift in priorities, the party could move beyond Clintonesque triangulation, build a new progressive majority and revive a beleaguered middle class. Ms. Warren wrote Mr. Obama a $250 check, making her one of the campaign’s earliest supporters. She remained in his camp, joining an advisory team that helped shape his 2004 agenda and providing a glowing endorsement for his 2008 campaign book “Change We Can Believe In.” Their relationship grew rockier after Mr. Obama entered the White House, but these felt like family squabbles.

She launched a charm offensive with leading progressive activists and staked out bold positions on subjects ranging from impeachment to reparations to the wealth tax. Underlying all of this was her conviction that she could rally the Obama coalition — young people, African-Americans, Hispanics and liberal white college graduates, with just enough of the white working class to win the Midwest — behind policies that took on the 1 percent.

As these elder millennials aged into maturity, the same ideal gave rise to new journalistic outlets like Vox. They gained new champions too, like the Warren protégée Katie Porter, who turned her suburban Orange County, Calif., congressional district blue in the 2018 wave election.

Ms. Warren tried to bend the Democratic Party to the left. Mr. Sanders’s core supporters are intent on remaking it from the ground up. They want a new coalition grounded in the multiracial working-class and less dependent on affluent professionals; a new donor class made up of grass-roots contributors; a new base of activists who read magazines like Jacobin and come out of groups like Democratic Socialists of America; and new politicians like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, who trounced New York’s Democratic machine. Mr. Sanders’s most loyal followers are as much part of a counterculture as they are members of a political campaign. Rather than asking the best and brightest to lead the way beyond left and right, they have come up with a novel fusion of populism and socialism that marries a critique of the inequalities generated by capitalism with a rejection of technocratic nudging and meritocratic striving. Tell them that Elizabeth Warren is the real radical, and they’ll ask what you can expect from an administration dominated by products of the same elite institutions that ran the Obama White House.

Even on its own, such a tax would be enough to force a lot of U.S. assets into foreign hands. Ms. Li and Mr. Smith write: A wealth tax would induce foreign inflows of hundreds of billions of dollars a year to replace reductions in U.S. savings, which would cause international investors to replace home-grown billionaires as owners of capital. Since this tax would specifically punish American owners of U.S. assets, who would suddenly have higher tax bills and a big incentive to spend rather than save, there would be bargains available for foreign investors looking to scoop up U.S. properties.

The Tax Foundation notes: Compared to income taxes, wealth tax rates seem much lower, but this rate can be deceptive. The best way to interpret wealth tax rates is to translate them into an equivalent income tax rate. For example, consider an investor who owns a long-term bond with a fixed rate of return at 5 percent each year. A 3 percent annual wealth tax would imply that 60 percent of the capital income from owning the long-term bond would be remitted as tax—the 3 percent wealth tax translates to a 60 percent income tax rate in this example. A 5 percent annual wealth tax would equal a 100 percent income tax rate, because the wealth tax would take all this taxpayer's capital income...	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

The Tax Foundation economists note: ... some economists have suggested that a wealth tax may encourage the owners of large fortunes to put their assets to more productive use instead of letting their wealth sit in low-yielding bonds. On one level this makes sense. Unless they reallocate towards higher yield investments, these taxpayers will see their wealth dwindle rapidly.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

However, of the four people for whom they gave detailed information, three paid income taxes of between 20 and 30 percent of their income — hardly an infinitesimal amount.

There are certainly arguments that this is a loophole — disproportionately enjoyed by the wealthy — that should be closed. But is ProPublica justified in disclosing private information that may have been improperly obtained? While disclosure of sensitive information can surely be justified where the public interest calls for it, there was nothing new in the story that warranted this questionable invasion of privacy.

The only problem: The president doesn't have that power. Congress passed a law in 2005 giving wide latitude to states to allow fracking.

2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, came to The Post on Tuesday to talk about why he is running for president and what he hopes to accomplish if elected. Here is the full transcript and audio recording of our conversation. — Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor Highlights of Patrick’s comments from the interview Click on a highlight to jump ahead in the transcript below. The full transcript Fred Hiatt, editorial page editor: Thank you so much for making the time. We'd like to ask you some questions and then publish the transcript of our conversation. Former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick: Thank you.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Fred Hiatt: We'd like to ask you some questions and then publish the transcript of our conversation. Deval Patrick: May I consult with counsel before? Fred Hiatt: Let's start big. What would you hope four years from now, when you're running for reelection? If you could point to two or three things that you'd accomplished. What would they be? Deval Patrick: The first would be that the House and the Senate and I will have signed the Democracy Agenda into law, which has to do with addressing all the ways we have treated, the many ways we have treated our democracy over time, as if we could tolerate limitless abuse without breaking: the amount of money, much of it dark in our politics; the hyperpartisan gerrymandering; the voter suppression, purging and other ways in which we make it hard to participate through difficult registration or registration barriers and to sustain your participation. And as a part of that, we have a program around expanding national service because it's one of things we were talking about downstairs, Jonathan [Capehart], I think one of the things that is so concerning to me about how divided we are, is that it's so easy to do so. And I think it's easy to do so because we don't know each other and we don't really have occasions to know each other anymore in this country.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	So I think making ways for people, much more broadly, you know, I don't think we're quite ready for Israel's mandatory system, but through opportunities, civilian or military, for people to give a year or two or three in service of an unmet need and to work alongside other Americans, from other parts of the country and different backgrounds, is an important way to begin to heal the lack of understanding among us as citizens. And I think it's critical that we do so. So I'd start there. We have a strategy we'll be rolling out, I think, tomorrow called the Opportunity Agenda, which is about how we grow the economy out, not just up — so out to the middle and the marginalized, and not just up to the well-connected — about investing time and ideas and money in education and innovation and infrastructure, and the interconnectedness of those. And I'd like us to have, at least, the building blocks in place and begun to demonstrate that the innovation economy can be made available to people outside of Boston and Silicon Valley and so forth, and should be made available. And, you know, I want to get it all done in the first term. And then there's a whole list of reforms, big systems from health care to immigration to criminal justice that are on our our docket as well.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Fred Hiatt: Just on national service. You describe it as an opportunity, not mandatory, but it would be paid, and it would bring free tuition. Deval Patrick: Yes. Fred Hiatt: So how much does it cost? And also, why not free tuition for everybody? Why do you make service a condition of free tuition? Deval Patrick: Well, first of all, the plan we're advocating is modeled on what [General] Stan McChrystal has developed. I'm a part of his group. I think it's a fabulous idea. And he has the idea of scaling it over time, I'd love to go to 100 percent right away but probably won't be able to do that as a practical matter. We have a lot of existing programs to build on, and I think we get some advantage on making those simpler, from Peace Corps to Teach for America. But we have lots of unmet needs is the point. And I think without making pay available, you know, my kids might get to do it, but other kids might not. And I do propose free tuition, public colleges and universities, or at least affordable tuition in public colleges and universities. And I think we do that by putting the public back in the public colleges and universities.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	The experience that I saw in Massachusetts is that we were down to, I want to say 25 percent public appropriation, and public colleges and universities had been trying to follow a model that private colleges and universities have been following, which is this theory of raising tuition as high as the so-called market would bear and raising financial aid alongside. And of course over time, we've migrated so that the blend of financial aid is much more in favor of loans than debt. And so we get what we get. And by the way, it was never going to work in the public context, if it ever has worked in the in the private context. So we have two issues, it seems to me, going forward. One is existing student debt. And I have some ideas about that.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	And then the go forward, I believe, is putting the public back into public higher ed. We moved to 50 percent in Massachusetts in exchange for freezing tuition and fees. But getting back to 100 percent, I think, is what we need to be. Molly Roberts, editorial writer: Can we move on to tech? Fred Hiatt: Yeah. Molly Roberts: Sure. So on the news, the attorney general just yesterday criticized Apple for refusing to unlock these devices at the center of the investigation in Pensacola. Deval Patrick: Right. Molly Roberts: So I'm curious for your thoughts on the debate about law enforcement access to encrypted data. Should there be rules mandating that companies provide technical assistance to law enforcement or create so-called back doors for them?	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Deval Patrick: Well, I don't know about back doors because I'm worried about back doors being kicked in in the interests of all kinds of argument, not all of it necessarily availing. I do think that I wouldn't want to let law enforcement have access without probable cause. And I'd want to have those standards reviewed by, and on the record, ruled on by a qualified judge and have that in an open process, as would happen in, you know, street crime or should happen in street crime. I have a lot of heartburn about the position that some of the most powerful factors in our society have today. I've been really troubled by the position that Facebook has taken on the accuracy of political ads. And I say that as an advocate of the First Amendment. But it just seems when we know what we know about foreign interference in the 2016 election, and in this one, and in elections since, that being quite as pure, is that the right way to say it, about the First Amendment? I mean, you don't get to yell ""fire"" in a crowded theater. And this to me is like that. So it's a little afield of your question, but that's been my mind.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Molly Roberts: Well, that was another question I had. Fred Hiatt: But before we leave the back door: So you don't want a back door that can be kicked in. But if there isn't one, even if a judge says, ""Yes, there's probable cause,"" Bill Barr is not going to be able to get in. So should Facebook be allowed to have encrypted apps or not? Deval Patrick: Well, I don't know why it would be so that a company that has had an order from court would then be exempted from making that information available. You're just talking about technically, how does it happen if — how do you comply…	7	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Fred Hiatt: I mean, with these old Apple phones that, in this case, Apple could get in. But, with a lot of new technology, it would be impossible. Molly Roberts: I think even Apple would say about these phones that it can't unlock these phones that are encrypted phones without essentially creating a back door that then could be exploited by criminals. Similarly, what Facebook would say about say, encrypted messaging, which is an option on Facebook Messenger, soon to be all Facebook Messenger, and is all of WhatsApp, it would say, ""If we create a way to intercept messages in motion, that's also for everyone, we destroy end-to-end encryption. And so government, we can't do this just for you in this case.""	8	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Deval Patrick: Molly, are first names okay? Molly Roberts: First names are lovely. Deval Patrick: I'm very cautious of false choices. And there is, in almost everything, a balance that has to be struck. And, you know, we get very particular about our privacy. And by the way, I am very particular about my privacy, in an age where we put every intimate detail up on social media. I want to believe, but I have no expert depth, that if a back door is what is necessary to be able to to comply with a justified order for access to information, pertinent to a crime, because there has been probable cause, that that back door can be guarded the rest of the time. And I realize that's exposure, and that worries me.	9	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	But simply saying, you know, the back door has to be existent and wide open or nonexistent seems to me like, without knowing all the technical capability, seems like one of those false choices we get peddled a lot in public life. Charles Lane, editorial writer: I would like to ask you, if I can, a couple things about the economy. One of the interesting things about the situation, well there's two interesting things: One is the economy is going relatively well, and at the same time, there are Democrats who have big, big theories of what's wrong with it, all the way from Andrew Yang with Universal Basic Income to Bernie Sanders with Democratic socialism.	10	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	So I would, sort of, like to ask you what your theory of the economic challenge is, and how you think it can be most practically dealt with. Deval Patrick: Is there time for anybody else, because that's a huge question? Charles Lane: We can break it up into little pieces. Deval Patrick: So I think, Charles, that the cheery economic indicators just don't tell the whole story. I'm out there talking to voters. I'm talking to Democrats. I'm talking to Republicans. I'm talking to independents. You know, unemployment is low as long as you count both, or all three, of the minimum wage jobs folks have to survive.	11	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Inflation is low as long as you look away from the cost of housing, education, health care, the very things that stabilize people and enable them to move onto a path of economic mobility. And by the way, the economic unease of a changing economy, the sort of thing that Andrew speaks to with his strategy around A.I., the anxiety, and in some cases even anger, associated with an economy that leaves a lot of people feeling, and frankly, just gets up and leaves, and leaves a lot of people feeling as if they don't have a place in an innovation economy where there is this much change. I recognize this from growing up on the South Side of Chicago. There were cheery economic indicators all through the time I was growing up there, too, but we were stuck. And the difference today, coming out of the recession, going into the recession, is that the poor have been stuck in poverty for a long time. But now the middle class is a paycheck or two away from being poor and deeply anxious about it. And by the way, I still don't believe, although we've been told that for 40 years, that the Dow Jones is an economic indicator. So I think that there are ways in which we have to — frankly, let me put it more positively, ways we can own the innovation economy instead of feeling like we are victimized by it. Our innovation, our spirit of innovation, our tradition of creativity and ingenuity in this country is unmatched. And we ought to harness that. What happens today and what has happened historically is that we're pretty good at the innovation part. We're not that good at the transition part. Meaning we move on to the next thing, and we get around to the consequences of that, if at all, later. So, you know, I think we have this huge opportunity to move to a green, clean future. In coal country, that might well be, and quite understandably, be scary. It's threatening. It's undermining of a way of life and a source of prosperity. We never go to coal country, and in fairness, I haven't yet either, and said, ""Look, this is happening. The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stone. The carbon age isn't going to end because we run out of carbon sources, [but] because we got a better idea. And how about you take this part of the idea? You be the place where we develop and test and manufacture wind blades, for example."" Please, I'm just being hypothetical. I haven't been to coal country, but I want to go.	12	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	We don't think ahead. Our short termism in business, that kind of quarter- to-quarter, get the return, sometimes at the sacrifice of the long-term interests of the enterprise, that bad habit has leaked into the way we govern ourselves. We govern from election cycle to election cycle, news cycle to news cycle, and not generation to generation. I think this is an opportunity for us to look out. And so when I talk about the opportunity agenda, I'm talking about investing in education, in innovation, in infrastructure. It's the strategy we used to come out of recession and get that 25-year employment high. And we came out faster than most other states. And it's about investing money, yes, but also time and ideas in pre-K to higher ed and in workforce development. Because we are increasingly a knowledge economy, and we need to be prepared for that. By the way, that's not everybody getting a university degree. The biggest gap we had in Massachusetts, and the biggest one we have in the United States, is the so-called middle-skills gap. And then innovation, meaning those industries that depend on a concentration of brainpower and on creativity, and they range from the life sciences and biotech to clean tech to advanced manufacturing, which is making a comeback in Massachusetts and around the country, those high-value products and services, entrepreneurialism and the capital and coaching to enable that. And then infrastructure, I always described as the unglamorous work of governing, Charles, but it's what supports everything else, and it's roads, rails, bridges, yes. But it's also broadband. It's also a distributed generation in the case of a modern electrical grid. You know, we have wooden water pipes under Boston — wooden. Not all of them, but there is still wooden water pipes under Boston. We have so much unmet need. And that kind of investment, around which I think there is broad consensus, creates jobs right now. But it also creates a platform for business investment and public ambition out into the future.	13	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Fred Hiatt: Since you brought up wind turbines, we asked readers for questions they would ask. And we got one from Truth or Consequences, New Mexico, so we have to include that. From Suzanne: ""What will you do to address climate change, and how would you pay for it?"" Deval Patrick: So I'll offer you, first of all, some of the things we did in Massachusetts, which I think there's a reason why we're a national model. We joined the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, which is a regional cap and trade system. Fred Hiatt: RGGI to its friends. Deval Patrick: RGGI, yes. And we use the proceeds to invest in energy efficiency, which I think is how we got to be rated first in the country in energy efficiency. We closed the remaining coal-fired power plants because we were generating enough alternative energy to meet growing demand. Population was increasing. Manufacturing was increasing in the same time. And we developed a statewide recovery and resilience program. We invested behind that. It was obviously tailored for regional differences, sea walls in one place, for example, different kinds of investments elsewhere.	14	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	I rarely mentioned, but I should. We're one of the few states where we saw a growth in small farms. And I can talk a little bit more about that. But the method of farming, at scale, was also sensitive to meeting our goals. Fred Hiatt: So nationally, would you support a cap and trade? Tax on carbon? What would be your… Deval Patrick: I'm very interested in the carbon tax. I'm only interested, by the way, if we use the proceeds to accelerate our movement toward a carbon-free future. But the reason I mentioned the job creation is, because among the false choices we get in politics is this notion that we can't have that kind of future without wrecking the economy. And our experience was that the clean-tech sector was one of a couple of sectors that helped us come out of recession faster than most others. And it was a whole range of skill sets, not just the Ph.Ds, but so-called middle-skills jobs as well.	15	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Ruth Marcus, deputy editorial page editor: You talked about the unglamorous work of governing. What is your theory of how you would govern if you were president with a Senate controlled by Republicans and Majority Leader McConnell? Deval Patrick: Yeah, you know, first of all, I have to say, there are words I shouldn't use. As troubling as I find his leadership, he understood the significance of Barack Obama's election more clearly sooner than almost everyone else. And I think that's why he was as extreme as he was right from the beginning, that the agenda of the party was to make Barack Obama a one-term president. Differently than my friend the former president, after, you know, trying, I'd take the case to the American people. It's a different kind of podium being president. I think being involved in competitive races, in places where — I mean, I'm a nice guy. I'm a gentleman.	16	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	I remember running into Leader McConnell in the airport at National during the 2012 election. And he said to me, he said, ""Governor,"" he said, ""you do a fine job defending the indefensible."" And I said, ""Leader McConnell, thank you very much. I hope you say the same thing when we win."" And he laughed. I laughed, and we won. But he did his thing and thwarted every idea, even if it was an idea the Republican Party had had before. So I think trying to work with the leadership is critical. But I think that ultimately we're going to have, this is back to the Democracy Agenda, we're going to have to have a government, a democracy that actually produces democratic results and outcomes. And when I say ""democrat,"" I don't mean party but the outcomes that are of the kind you would expect from a representative democracy.	17	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	And if that's thwarted, then I think we've got to be out on the hustings working against those candidates. Ruth Marcus: Two tricky questions related to that: Number one, wasn't that what President Obama kept doing, going out on the hustings and telling us that the next election was gonna break the fever and then Republicans would come to the table? And number two, would you get rid of the legislative filibuster? Deval Patrick: You know, first of all, I think that the Obama administration and the president did some of that but could have done more. And please don't hear that as a critique. But I remember working on the stimulus bill during the transition. You remember?	18	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Ruth Marcus: I do. Deval Patrick: It was an emergency. And there were five governors who were working real hard in trying to develop this package. And you probably all know this story. But we talked with economists from both sides. This is when I first began to hear that an economist could have a side. I thought that was just an economist. But we talked with economists who had worked with both campaigns and with Dems and Republicans. And I remember that they said one of the things you have to do is be sure that it is big enough to have a psychological impact, because a certain amount of what is happening is psychological. And we said, what's that number? And the consensus was a trillion dollars. That's a lot of money. That's the point. And then they said, I'm summarizing, that all of the spending has to be stimulative, meaning things where people will put the money back out on the street as fast as possible: direct benefits, so-called shovel-ready, I think that was the term, infrastructure projects, stuff like that. And don't waste a dollar on non-stimulative stuff. The compromise in our conversation was to have some portion of it for education, because that is one of the things that gets cut in state budgets. And if you're in the second grade, you know, you don't get to sit out the second grade until the recession is over. You know, your chance is now. So we had a portion in there for education. We took it to the incoming administration and they said, ""Well, it's gotta be bipartisan. Go see what the Congress thinks."" And Rahm took it up there, Rahm Emanuel. And he came back and said, ""Took it to the Democratic leadership and said, trillion dollars, the sticker shock, it has to be another number."" What's the number? And that's how we got to 750.	19	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Deval Patrick: Yes, we hadn't gone to the Republicans yet. I'm getting to the punchline. I stink at sound bites. It takes me a while. And then so it got to be 750. And the agreement on the Democratic side was it would be a third, you remember. Anyway, we took it to the Republican side, and they said, ""Well, we have to have tax cuts."" And all of the economists had said tax cuts are not stimulative. And they said, ""That's the only way we will support it."" And the president said, ""I want my first bill to be bipartisan.""	20	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	The Washington Post (Online)	The Washington Post Editorial Board interviews 2020 candidate Deval Patrick	txt-opeds/2338891258.xml.txt	Get it? So the compromise was a third tax cuts, a third infrastructure and a third direct services. And that's how it went to the floor. And not a single Republican voted for it. And I remember saying then to the president-elect, ""There is a lesson here. There's a lesson here. You are at the top of your game right now. And you may not want to blast him on this first one, but they are sending you a signal, and you need to send them and the general public one back. You know, as I would say to him, a little South Side, not a bad thing. So I think he did some of that. And I think it's important. I'm not talking about dialing up the tit for tat and feuding and all that sort of thing. But I'm talking about calling the question. Because to me, if the character of the candidates is always an issue, this time, this time it's the character of the country. We should call that question, and we should govern. I think we as Democrats, we win when we call that question. And then I think we should govern accordingly. These are generational decisions, hard ones, not easy ones. But what it takes to leave something better, that old-fashioned generational responsibility we were all taught by our grandparents, may not produce a political benefit in the short run or in time for the next election. But to me, that is what the job demands right now.	21	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Deval Patrick: And filibuster. Do you see me trying to avoid the question? I was filibustering around the question. I learned I'd love for the filibuster to go until there's something I want filibustered. Right? I'm reluctant, and I learned, in some ways the hard way, as a new executive in Massachusetts about trying to tell the legislature what their rules ought to be. I know it's a thing now to decry the filibuster, but I'm going to hold my fire on that. Charles Lane: Back to calling the question, as you put it. I think that's a really interesting way to look at, kind of, what's going on within the field of Democratic candidates right now. Because, again, in the case of Bernie Sanders and perhaps Elizabeth Warren, the idea of calling the question is really transformational policy, very, very high-level: Medicare-for-all, etc, etc., wealth taxes, things that potentially, whether you're for them or against them, could cause a lot of conflict with the legislature or in Congress. So my question to you is, when you think of calling the question and determining the character of the country, why are you or how do you feel about the need for some very large-scale policy transformation as part of that? Because when you answered about the economy, it seemed like you were perhaps, there was nothing there really about the wealth tax or Medicare-for-all or anything like that.	22	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

So I didn't get to some of those questions. So let me say, first of all, I'll do the health-care question. We'll talk about taxes. There was a third thing... Fred Hiatt: Well, talk about this. Do we need revolutionary change? Charles Lane: Transformational. Fred Hiatt: How do you feel when you're hearing those kinds of comments? Deval Patrick: Well, I think that every once in a while, America confronts the gap between our reality and our ideals, and we reinvent ourselves. And I think that is one of the most challenging and one most exciting things about this moment. And I say that not as a Democrat alone but as an American. And I think that when I hear about issues — Charles, talking about the the economic indicators? The economic indicators haven't described what life was like on the South Side of Chicago where I grew up and neighborhoods like it for a long time. Folks have been stuck in poverty for a long time. The difference is today that the middle class, as I said, is a paycheck or two away from being poor and really anxious about it. The whole idea that you can imagine a different future for yourself and your family and then reach for it, it's a fundamental notion about what we're about, is something a whole lot of folks have lost faith in or are losing confidence in.

It's so interesting that, you know, ""We're not talking about very bold..."" Ninety-nine percent of the people in Massachusetts have health care. We have universal or nearly universal care. There is more than one way to get there. And the reason I favor a public option rather than Medicare-for-all, by the way, that public option could well be Medicare, but because I think there is a value — excuse me, Jonathan, if I'm repeating myself from earlier. But I think there's a value in having the competitive tension between a private insurance industry that you better believe is going to come up with a competitive product for all the people who are moving to that no-cost or low-cost public option. And that's good because it is an incentive for system costs to come down. And there's also a value in CMS having to step up their game. Because if you are eligible for Medicare and you can, most people will buy a supplemental policy on top of it because Medicare doesn't get the job done. And the whole notion that that is somehow less bold? I mean to me, nowadays, a moderate is a progressive who actually gets stuff done.	24	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

To me, the opportunity here is about orienting our political decision-making around the long-term and generational change instead of what makes a great slogan in time for the next election. On taxes, I don't support the wealth tax mostly because I don't think wealth is the problem. Greed is the problem. We want aspiration. I grew up poor. Nobody said the way you lift yourself out of poverty is resenting the people uptown. They told us, ""Play by the rules and work hard, and you will have your chance."" And by the way, when I reflect on the fact that it was old black people who told me that, the expression of their faith in this country and its values is a mind-blowing thing.	25	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

And so rather than the wealth tax, I'd raise the estate tax. I think it was 55 back an iteration or two ago. And if I think of those as nonrecurring revenues rather than income and corporate tax as recurring revenues, then that's where I see the source of reducing or eliminating existing student debt. So that's backward-looking rather than forward-looking. And frankly, we ought to be investing in paying down some of the national debt as well, and deficit.

But I would love to see and will propose, frankly, radical simplification: progressive rates; few or far fewer deductions and exemptions; I'd keep the mortgage deduction, charitable deduction, maybe the child tax credit. But otherwise, everybody should contribute according to their means. And we ought to get past this notion that tax is a penalty instead of the price of civilization.

We should go to 25, and then we should finish the work and eliminate the loopholes because those go in as arguments for making a so-called noncompetitive rate more competitive. Well, if the rate comes down to a point where it's competitive, why keep the loopholes? Again, simple, straightforward. Everybody contributes. And we don't have some of the most profitable companies in the world paying zero in their share of the price of civilization. I'm sorry.	28	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

NAEP scores are stagnant. International tests show American students lagging the rest of the world. And this despite a lot of reforms that were advanced by the Obama administration. Accountability, data, stiffening of standards. Did it not work, are the critics right that the reform didn't work? Deval Patrick: I think, you know, we were, as you probably know, in Massachusetts on a journey to improve the schools before I got there. And we invested behind that at the highest level in the history of the Commonwealth, even when the bottom, thanks to the stimulus bill, even when the bottom was falling out of the global economy.	29	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But I'm not sure — and I'm, in fact, I'll be more affirmative — I am sure there's more to it than that, because we had persistent achievement gaps. And the kids who were stuck in those gaps were poor or kids who spoke English as a second language or had special learning needs. And they're our kids, too. You know, we had kind of looked the other way, because we had the bragging rights around NAEP. But as I say, they're our kids, too. Demonstrating for me, I think, a real insight about being governor or being president, that the greatest power is the convening power. That, you know, you call a meeting, and the people you invite will come even if they never talk to the people across the table. And so we got 'em all around the table: the public school teachers and unions, the charter folks, the public policy experts, the parent organizations, the poverty organizations, everybody was around the table, never talked to each other the rest of the time. And I remember saying, look, for once, let's not argue about what's good for the adults. Let's focus on what's good for the kids. What do they need? And the obvious first conclusion was different kids need different things. And so trying to have a solution for a whole population of children, without taking account of differences in those children or in the communities where they live and are educated, was barking up the wrong tree. So we came up with a suite of tools with some resources behind them and an accountability plan. Teachers or others could develop that plan. They had some time. They got some money behind it. They developed and we agreed on the means of folks being accountable for results.	30	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

About a year and a half after that bill was signed, the Achievement Gap Act, I went to visit a school called Orchard Gardens in Boston. Orchard Gardens was the school described by other educators in Boston, no matter how bad things were at the other school, they'd say, at least we're not Orchard Gardens. And in a year and a half, Orchard Gardens had gone from one of the worst in Boston to one of the best in the state. They were using all these different tools. Longer school days, smaller class size. They had City Year, it's a volunteer organization, come in to help with truancy issues and to mentor or to coach during homework time, art, exercise, music. Frankly, they were doing things at Orchard Gardens that we did for our kids in the suburbs. And the parents were engaged again, it was completely different. And they had great leadership. So I think that it isn't all about account, frankly. Look, I had big, broken, overcrowded schools, sometimes violent, on the South Side of Chicago and amazing teachers who were prepared and supported and conveyed their high expectations to us so that we would begin to have high expectations of ourselves. I'm smiling because I can think of my sixth- and third-grade teachers who were in my life until they passed away.	31	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

We seemed to be close to war with Iran last week. So I wanted to ask you a little bit about that and your responses to the Council on Foreign Relations. You said you wanted to promote some kind of accommodation between Iran and Saudi Arabia. You also said, though, that you wanted to cut off arms sales to Saudi Arabia and help for the war in Yemen and that you wanted to push back against Iran in the region. So I was left wondering, how do you fit those three elements together, and does it involve leaving American troops in Iraq and Syria?	32	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But I think that right has to be bound by international norms and by law and by forethought. Not there, not anywhere, should we undertake an action like we did in Iraq against General Soleimani or anyone else without thinking three or four steps ahead. And what was concerning to me is that we have a president who has demonstrated not just his failure to think ahead, but his disdain for thinking ahead, which just makes us all less safe. What I meant, I didn't see what was written, but what I meant is, I'm very interested in how we think about regions comprehensively. You know, we have interests today with our own troops on the ground and our allies' troops on the ground, we have our most important ally in the region, in Israel, right in the middle of it all. And we have a relationship with Saudi Arabia, which, well, we have an ally in Saudi Arabia whose relationship with us is not entirely consistent with our own values. And I think that has been true in different parts of the world at different times in our history. And I bring that up because I do think that is our unique power. And our fealty to those values at home — those values meaning equality, opportunity, fair play — makes us stronger abroad, is the reason we get to lead. Nations of great armies and wealth have come and gone with the winds of time. But the fact that we bring alongside that the values we do is what makes us unique, gives us a unique opportunity leading in the world.	33	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

You ever heard of that? It's a program that brings young Israeli and Palestinian entrepreneurs from the region, including Gaza, by the way, equal numbers of men and women to Brandeis [University] in the summer. And they work on business ideas together. And it gets winnowed down by vote of the group to a few with teams of Israelis and Palestinians. They get a little seed money, and then they launch the businesses back in the region. It's about, I think, four cohorts at this point.	34	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

And in the debrief with the advisory board, asking ourselves whether the most important thing was the success of the enterprises or the success of the relationships. And I think we concluded, because it was just magic watching them come to understand and respect each other as they did that, that the success of the relationships was probably key. And I bring that up because I learned and I can't remember now who told me, but it might have been Secretary Kerry, that the Iran nuclear deal was ultimately made possible because there was a young Iranian and a young, I want to say, Jordanian, who had a relationship of trust, and were able then to get to the hard work of hammering out a deal, as incomplete as it was.

Jackson Diehl: And we still need U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria? Deval Patrick: At this minute, without having all of the information available to a president, I just don't know. It's very hard to tell from a distance. And we don't get consistent explanations or insights from the administration. You know, it feels to me like we ought to have our troops in Iraq come home.

And it's not what they signed up for. So I have some sense of the of the wear and tear on our military men and women.

Deval Patrick: Well, look, I remember when I left the South Side of Chicago to come to Milton Academy, it was through a scholarship program called A Better Chance. And I showed up at Milton the fall of 1970, the night before classes began, I'd never seen it before. Or any place like it. They had a dress code in those days, and the boys wore jackets and ties to classes. So my grandparents splurged on a new jacket for me to wear to class. A jacket on the South Side of Chicago is a Windbreaker. So the next morning, all these boys are putting on their blue blazers and their tweed coats, and I had my Windbreaker, and I thought, ""Oh, boy, I've got a lot to learn."" I remember feeling that as I was making new friends, they were interested in my life on the South Side of Chicago you know, but [only] so much.

I think that part of what we have to do is model. We have made, I think, in this country‚ and I say this as someone who's practiced it at the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and was head of the Civil Rights Division and has been involved in one form or another in the questions of social and economic justice for my whole professional life, that we have made an uneasy, sometimes uneasy peace with the notion of nondiscrimination in America, much of it in my lifetime.

We don't know that history. A lot of us don't know that history. We need to confront that history and work our way through it. Fred Hiatt: With reparations?

I'm not speaking as a politician, and I'm speaking from my own aspirations and the aspirations of everyone I meet. And it doesn't mean I'm not angry. I'm angry, too. I've been angry for generations. This is my point. We can do relative suffering if you want. It never seems to get us anywhere. To me, it's not the point.

I am acknowledging the division, but I'm also acknowledging it doesn't have to be this way. There isn't a single challenge we face that we haven't made and that we can't overcome. And so when you drill right down to folks who are feeling, you know, the white guy who is in the questioner's question, who is feeling threatened by the changing economy? I understand that. What that person may not understand, but I think it is helpful to say anyway, is that the white woman, the brown woman, the black and brown guy in some other part of the country, the person who lives and works in rural America or a hollowed out small town, is feeling that way, too. And so how we think about industrial strategy, how we think about education strategy and how we campaign has to be about everyone, everywhere. And how we think out about the future and assuring that the benefits aren't all concentrated in a few, but are in fact, shared and shaped by everyone, everywhere, depends on policy choices we all make together.

And celebrated those that helped us, not just get runners off the suspended course and get them watered and warmed and reunited with their families, but made us come out of that trauma stronger than we were when we went in.

Do you think about just appointing judges as young and as far to the left as possible as a counter to the Trump judiciary? Do you think about it differently?

You know, I don't have to tell you how disciplined Leader McConnell has been in filling the court with activist right-wingers. Frankly, I think we should reconsider any appointment rated unqualified. And there have been a few of those. There is an impeachment process, and we should consider that for the unqualified judges. I am open to considering expanding the court, but it's not the first thing I would do. I do think that the idea of turning appointments over to an organization is an abdication of responsibility. You know, the American Constitution Society is a great source for judges truer, in my view, to constitutional principles and interpretation. I'm certainly willing to consult there, but I wouldn't limit myself to them for the same reasons I wouldn't tease you with the names of people I would consider. I have not done all that work, and as president, you have so many more resources available to you to uncover and discover talent that you may not already know. So I can tell you I think that the Constitution is a brilliant document designed to be a living document. It was flawed from the start. It's not going to be entirely repaired, nor is our judicial system going to be entirely repaired, by better and more honest interpretations of the existing document. There are some things that I think we should do by amendment, like overturn Citizens United.

The Massachusetts senator is unquestionably the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, which made her the focal point of attacks from her rivals in Tuesday's Democratic debate. Former vice president Joe Biden had an easier time of it, but this was not good news for him. At various points during the three-hour marathon, he faded away. His rivals no longer see him as the person to beat. Beneath the jostling for position lay an important policy subtext. Warren was plainly far more comfortable defending her broader economic positions, particularly her proposed wealth tax, than she was in standing up for Medicare-for-all. The tax on wealth goes to the heart of her candidacy's purposes. Medicare-for-all appears to be a position she adopted — somewhat belatedly — to fend off Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and attacks from her left. Her continued success depends on how she handles this tension.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Their decisions defined the difficult political terrain Warren faces. Her rise depended on her ability, simultaneously, to pull left-wing Democrats away from Sanders while also gaining new support from more moderate progressives. She made it look effortless. It will be effortless no longer. The debate also marked a reconfiguration at the other end of the party. While Biden remains near (and, in some polls, still at) the top of the field, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen.

""This is shameful, shameful what this man has done,"" Biden declared. Nonetheless, it was Buttigieg especially, but also Klobuchar, who dominated the discussion on the party's center-left. Up to now, Buttigieg has prospered as a refreshing new voice in the party, but struggled to break out of single digits. He was earning more acclaim than support. On Tuesday, he played to win. He was scalding in challenging Warren's refusal to say whether she would have to raise middle-class taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all. ""Your signature, Senator, is to have a plan for everything. Except this,"" Buttigieg said. ""No plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare-for-all plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in.""	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Klobuchar was also forceful — particularly in discussing the opioid crisis — blending moderation with family anecdotes that brought home her Minnesota roots. Still, both Midwesterners need Biden to weaken substantially and rather quickly, and the former vice president may be doing well enough to keep that from happening. But will Klobuchar and Buttigieg slow Warren's rise? Perhaps surprisingly, the moderates and Sanders share an interest in pointing out that Warren has not always been as enthusiastic about Medicare-for-all as she is now. She was careful in a New York Times interview earlier this year to endorse it, but she stressed the goal of ""moving us to a place where everybody is covered at the lowest possible cost"" and stressed ""there are a lot of different ways to get there. Medicare-for-all  has a lot of different paths for how we get there.""

There are lots of ways to go about doing that. There's the electability argument. Third Way, a moderate Democratic group that Sanders has attacked, found in a recent survey: By a wide 63–32% margin, Democratic primary voters want the candidate with the best shot at beating [President] Trump over one who matches their policy preferences.

O'Rourke has sternly resisted calls for Medicare-for-all; now is his chance to engage with Warren on the topic. Moreover, rather than warmed-over socialism from the 1960s (or 1930s), moderate candidates can set out a pro-growth policy that decreases income inequality. Capitalism is unparalleled in its ability to generate wealth and innovation, but it must be tempered with an adequate safety net and substantial investment in those who don't have the benefit of generational wealth.

This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Universal student-debt cancellation is a bad idea. It would be a big handout to Americans from upper-income families, most of whom are able to pay off their loans without too much trouble. “Education debt,” as Sandy Baum and Victoria Lee of the Urban Institute have written, “is disproportionately concentrated among the well-off.” (If you’re skeptical, I laid out the evidence in a recent column.) A much better idea would be an enormous investment in colleges that enroll large numbers of middle-class and lower-income students. These colleges tend to be underfunded and suffer from high dropout rates. This investment program could be combined with targeted debt forgiveness for those college graduates (and especially nongraduates) unable to repay their loans.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Coulda Been Worse	txt-opeds/2215016989.xml.txt	When I heard this week that Elizabeth Warren was instead proposing a sweeping debt-relief program, I was disappointed. Her campaign has been full of ideas to reduce poverty and lift middle-class living standards. A big debt-cancellation program is much less progressive than most of her ideas. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] But as I dug into the details of her new proposal, I discovered that it wasn’t as bad as I had first feared. It is more targeted than her campaign has sometimes made it sound (such as the headline on this Medium post). Her plan is considerably less regressive than universal debt cancellation would be.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-04-26	New York Times (Online)	Warren’s Education Plan? Coulda Been Worse	txt-opeds/2215016989.xml.txt	I still don’t love the idea. Warren would wipe out up to $50,000 in debt for anyone making less than $100,000 a year. Which means that a 24-year-old in Silicon Valley making $90,000 — and on a path to earn far more — could get a windfall. And people earning up to $250,000 — say, a 27-year-old investment banker or corporate lawyer — would get some benefit from the plan. Warren would also make tuition free at every public college, including those with overwhelmingly upper-income students, like the University of Virginia and the University of Michigan. This money would do much more good if it instead went to community colleges, which are typically starved of resources, as Richard Kahlenberg noted in a Times Op-Ed.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

First, people earning more than $100,000 a year can’t get the full $50,000 in debt relief; someone earning $220,000 could get only $10,000, for example. Second, the $50,000 cap means that people who took on more debt to get a degree in business, law and medicine — and are often earning very high salaries — will still have to pay back some of their loans. A few statistics, which the campaign gave me, help highlight the targeted nature of the proposal: It would cancel only 40 percent of all outstanding student debt.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

A universal debt-cancellation program would widen the wealth gap between white and black households, but Warren’s plan would narrow it. In effect, Warren’s plan is focused on people with small and modest-size debts, who also tend to be those who have the most trouble paying off their loans, surprising as that may sound.

She has the most detailed agenda, by far, of any presidential candidate, and that agenda would do a lot to help millions of Americans who need it. For more, Jared Bernstein, writing in The Washington Post, likes her plan more than I do, while Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute likes it less than I do. I also recommend Warren’s Medium post, despite the misleading headline. In the second half of it, she proposes several promising ideas to make higher education more equitable, like more funding for Pell Grants and for colleges focused on minority students.

Many are self-defined centrists, meaning they are socially liberal and fiscally conservative.

Former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz speaks to them, or would if he wasn't risking dividing up the anti-Trump vote, especially when he says things like, ""What the Democrats are proposing is as false as the wall. And that is free health care for all, which the country cannot afford"" and ""we can go after entitlements,"" without mentioning raising things such as Social Security's payroll tax cap. So does former New York mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who comes with the added benefit of having proved he could govern, and who said about Warren, when she was first running for Senate in 2012, ""You can question, in my mind, whether she's God's gift to regulation, close the banks and get rid of corporate profits, and we'd all bring socialism back, or the U.S.S.R.''	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The men and women of Wall Street also trust former vice president Joe Biden and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, even though, as White so delicately phrased it, ""few really know his positions.""

Many badmouthed him frequently. (Blackstone co-founder Steve Schwarzman compared a proposed tax increase that never came to pass as ""like when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939."") But, in retrospect, those were halcyon days. No major Wall Street figure was ever indicted on charges stemming from the financial crash. The stock market more than doubled under Obama's watch. Besides, you could criticize Obama publicly and not worry that he would lambaste you on Twitter, and not resort to giving anonymous carping quotes to Politico out of ""fear of angering a volatile president."" The real issue is one that big finance can't acknowledge: They got to have it all for decades. Even as the incomes of ordinary Americans stagnated while their own pay and wealth soared, the people of Wall Street could adopt socially progressive positions on matters of lifestyle and race and still call themselves moderate centrists. They could donate small portion of their money — as much as they choose ! — to charities to help the poverty-stricken, and get taken seriously as philanthropists, while getting to set the agenda. Their anger and fear isn't just at the fact they are getting challenged on their self-righteous self-image.

Liberal democracies value divided governmental institutions, a regulated market economy, a generous welfare state, personal autonomy and the expansion of political rights to formerly excluded classes. Conservatives and liberals alike are ""liberals"" in this broader sense, but American liberals believe more fervently than conservatives in the power of governmental means to achieve human betterment, and liberals tend to scorn habit and tradition as impediments to righteous goals. The goals of today's liberalism are minor and uninspiring. It has little else to do than tinker with the welfare state, ban things deemed dangerous or unhealthy and oppose conservatives. That has been the case for half a century. American liberalism's last great triumphs came during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Food Stamp Act of 1964 and the Social Security Amendments of 1965, which created Medicaid and Medicare.

But both came about as a result of court decisions. Neither could have passed the U.S. Congress. The best evidence that liberals are out of ideas is that they are busy regressing on the ones they had. An obvious example: Liberals since John Stuart Mill have espoused freedom of speech almost as a matter of religious faith, but one now finds astonishingly few people on the left prepared to defend it in a principled way, and quite a few urging governments and corporations to censor unpopular views. Most liberals no longer see much of a problem with campus speech codes. And liberals often seem to believe that the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech applies to everything but political speech. Artistic expression, pornography, violent videos, yes; a movie critical of Hillary Clinton—which the government sought to censor in the Citizens United case—no.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

From the Reform Bills in Britain in the 19th century to the suffragette movement in the early 20th century to the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and '60s, liberals cared passionately about extending full political rights to groups that lacked them. But everybody has the vote now. Stories of large-scale voter intimidation are not credible. Some favor enfranchising felons and aliens, including those in the country illegally, but these causes cannot sustain a political movement. Opportunistic complaints about the Electoral College aside, liberals began long ago to distrust universal suffrage. They are generally happy to entrust unelected and unaccountable bureaucrats and elites, domestic and transnational, with vast authority, and they are content to let federal courts decide almost any question, in defiance of legislation and popular will, provided the decision falls on the liberal side.	5	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

It is to point out that liberalism in America achieved the last of its great aims a half-century ago. Since then, liberal successes have steadily diminished in importance. The Clean Air Act of 1970 and the Clean Water Act of 1972 empowered state and federal governments to alleviate pollution. In 1979 Jimmy Carter signed legislation creating the Education Department, but its function has never been clear. In 1996 Bill Clinton signed a monumental welfare-reform law, but its purpose was to curb liberalism's excesses, not to further its aims. Then there was the Affordable Care Act of 2010, a nonradical version of a radical idea that managed to make an expensive and confusing system even more expensive and confusing.	7	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It's not the fault of America's Democrats that they've run out of ideas. Liberal democracies and center-left parties across Europe have reached a similar stasis. But stasis is itself the problem, because liberalism is a restless philosophy. It must always be doing something.

That liberals have found climate change such an attractive issue is a sign of this enervation. There is nothing inherently liberal about taxing carbon emitters or subsidizing solar energy, even if it may be humane or necessary. It's hard to take liberals' interest in climate seriously, since if they actually believed what they claim about the planet's coming inundation, they would support the immediate expansion of zero-emission nuclear power.

2014-05-19	New York Times (Online)	To Lift Up the Poor, Must We Soak the Rich?	txt-opeds/2213367063.xml.txt	Over at the Upshot, Jared Bernstein chides conservatives who have responded to the inequality debate by arguing that we should focus on lifting up the poor instead of chopping down the incomes of the 1 percent; the reality, he argues, is that you can’t have any sort of uplift without some good old-fashioned soaking of the rich: For a three-idea argument, I suppose it’s appropriate to raise three objections. So here they are: 1) I don’t think even Bernstein believes that it’s actually impossible to improve the situation of the poor without directly raising taxes on the rich. What about, to pick two ideas favored by various thinkers on the left and right, a one-two punch of criminal justice reform to reduce incarceration rates and urban upzoning to lower the cost of living and working in wealthy cities? Both would probably improve opportunity for the poor and the lower-middle class; neither would require a higher top marginal tax rate or massive new public outlays. Do these kind of ideas just not count?	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2014-05-19	New York Times (Online)	To Lift Up the Poor, Must We Soak the Rich?	txt-opeds/2213367063.xml.txt	2) It’s possible to favor increasing redistribution along something like the lines Bernstein suggests — through an expanded earned income tax credit, for instance — while disagreeing that we need a higher top marginal rate or a Piketty-style wealth tax in order to do it. Given that our existing tax code, like the zoning policies mentioned above, has a heavy pro-rentier and pro-rich bias, why couldn’t we start by cutting or capping existing tax subsidies — for expensive homes, for expensive health insurance, for being a wealthy taxpayer in a high tax state — and put that money to work first? This would involve “new revenue,” in a sense, but you wouldn’t have to raise tax rates (as we already just did) in order to get it, and you would be redistributing unearned, effectively-subsidized riches rather than just hacking away more indiscriminately at the idle and entrepreneurial alike. (Politicians can’t phrase it this way, of course, but sometimes the best way to encourage upward mobility is to make downward mobility a little more likely …)	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2014-05-19	New York Times (Online)	To Lift Up the Poor, Must We Soak the Rich?	txt-opeds/2213367063.xml.txt	3) Before we talk about significantly expanding our investments in education, elementary and collegiate, how confident should we feel that our existing “investment” in the “future productivity” of the poorest Americans is reaping value-for-the-dollar rewards? I came to Bernstein’s piece, for instance, fresh off reading Dale Russakoff’s sobering dispatch from Newark’s education wars, which depicts a city with generous per-student spending and a catastrophic education system struggling (and struggling, and struggling …) to turn Mark Zuckerberg’s famous $100 million pledge into a catalyst for real reform. Russakoff’s story doesn’t grind an ideological ax: You might read it and come away convinced that even if costs were out of control and the bureaucracy disastrous, it was always going to take an infusion of new money to create any opening for reform; or you might take the more left-wing view that billionaire’s gifts are poisoned chalices, and that true school reform requires overwhelming bureaucratic problems with public money and only public money, and heaps of it. But I think it’s fair to say that the news from Newark raises the question — which can also be reasonably raised about other regions in our education system, and about other forms of public spending as well — of whether the crucial issue when it comes to uplift and upward mobility isn’t money qua money, but how that money is actually being spent, and the culture of the institutions spending it. And it indicates, if nothing else, that even if soaking the rich and investing the money in the public sector can help the poor, it doesn’t necessarily do so, and you can’t just make public policy on the assumption that it will.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

This astounding claim, presented in the media as fact and evidence of inequities baked into President Trump's 2017 tax cut, came from two economists at the University of California, Berkeley. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman asserted that 2018 was the first year in U.S. history that the average tax rate on the 400 wealthiest income earners dipped below the rates paid by the lower-middle class and poor. Finally, we had proof the rich weren't paying their fair share. But new data from the Internal Revenue Service suggest it isn't true.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

At the time they published their study, the IRS had yet to release the data necessary to make the calculations they described. Preliminary numbers for 2018 , covering all filings made by last year's Oct. 15 extended deadline, came out only last week. These data tell a very different story: America's wealthiest earners still carry the lion's share of the tax burden. Closer inspection reveals that Messrs. Saez and Zucman imputed the tax rates they claim for 2018 from records that predated the Trump tax cut, and therefore didn't capture its effect on the measured distribution of income. They built in opaque assumptions that now appear to have exaggerated the tax cut's benefit to high-income earners.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Their alleged 23% tax rate paid by the highest earners—encompassing all federal, state and local taxes—fell below the Congressional Budget Office's estimates for the top income percentile's federal tax rate alone. The two economists' tax rates for the poor also looked suspiciously high. A 25% rate for the lowest quintile of earners would be almost twice the level found in , including those using better-established data from the Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The discrepancy arose from Messrs. Saez and Zucman's exclusion of the earned-income tax credit for low-income households, artificially inflating the amount of tax the poor really pay.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Saez and Zucman's entire narrative of a regressive U.S. tax system designed to favor the rich at the expense of the poor. The IRS reports effective income-tax rates on the adjusted gross incomes of different groups of earners. That's the percentage of income that people actually pay to the government, as distinct from the statutory tax rate. According to the IRS, the top 0.01% of earners—those with incomes above $10 million—paid a 24.8% effective federal income-tax rate in 2018. This isn't very different from the 25.3% the group paid in 2017, and is higher than the average rate of 22.5% on the same group during the George W. Bush administration. As these rates only encompass federal income taxes, most filers can expect to add another 8% to 12% of income from other forms of taxation, placing their total burden well above the Saez-Zucman numbers.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It's true the remainder of the top 1% (those with incomes between roughly $500,000 and $10 million) paid a slightly higher effective rate, at 26.5%, than the top 0.01% did. But tax rates drop rapidly from there, with filers in the $50,000 to $75,000 reporting bracket (approximately the median U.S. family income) facing an average federal income-tax rate of 8.4%. People who earned between $15,000 and $40,000 paid an average federal rate of merely 4% of their adjusted gross incomes in 2018. And thanks to the earned-income tax credit and others like it, the poorest earners paid very little if any federal income tax at all.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The Trump tax cut hasn't changed that. In 2018, the top 1% of U.S. earners paid roughly 37% of all federal income taxes. The top 5% paid around 58%. This suggests that policy makers wishing to mitigate regressive features of the tax system should look elsewhere. State and local sales and property taxes may be a more promising area for reform. The IRS's preliminary data also suggests that the needle on income inequality—the motive force behind the Saez-Zucman research and the wealth-tax proposals it has been used to support—hasn't moved lately. The share of adjusted gross income that went to the top 1% in 2018 was essentially the same as it was a decade earlier, at least going by the IRS numbers. The same is true of the top 0.1% and even the top 0.01%, the ultrarich so often targeted in political rhetoric from the left.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The corporate income-tax cut, for example, will likely prompt high earners to shift income from their personal returns to corporate returns, further lowering the measured income shares of the top 1%. Ironically, the reduction in the corporate tax rate could lead to a statistical reduction in income inequality.

Perhaps you missed ""Progress and Poverty's"" anniversary while perusing this year's equally improbable bestseller, ""Capital in the Twenty-First Century"" by French economist Thomas Piketty.

Analyzing the stagnant economy and rich-poor gap of his day, George blamed not free markets, which he considered efficient and fair, but their corruption by a privileged few. Specifically, George argued, land owners commanded a high and growing share of U.S. income even though their claim to it was based on something as unproductive as mere ownership -- as opposed to the laborer's work effort or the investor's risk-taking.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Since land could neither be created nor destroyed, taxing it would reduce neither society's total wealth nor owners' incentives to put property to productive use -- buildings and other improvements wouldn't be taxed. To the contrary, taxing land, and only land, to pay the government's bills would liberate labor and capital to seek their most productive use and thus to grow the economy.

Unless its foundations be laid in justice, the social structure of the United States or any other country cannot stand.""

""Extreme inequality makes it impossible to have proper working of democratic institutions,"" Piketty told a recent meeting at Washington's Urban Institute. And so, updating Henry George's single tax, Piketty proposes a global wealth tax, making similar claims about its benefits for both equality and growth.

Alas, Piketty's global wealth tax and George's single tax suffer from the same defect, and it's not political impracticality -- after all, George nearly got himself elected mayor of New York City in 1886. It's the inherent difficulty of separating the productive, untaxed component of the return on land or capital from the unproductive, taxed part. Clear in the pages of a treatise, the distinction is murkier in practice. The market price of a vacant lot can reflect potential productive uses, as well as the risk a buyer takes by betting on them.

The potential for adverse unintended consequences -- economic and political -- is greater than Piketty seems to realize. Great private fortunes can indeed entitle their owners to an undue share of society's current income and political power. At times, however, private wealth can serve as a font of charity or, indeed, a bulwark against government overreach.

But the prospect terrifies me, and it should terrify you, too. That’s not to say that it’s the wrong move. Arguably, it’s the only move, at least in terms of fidelity to the Constitution and to basic decency. From the moment that Trump stepped into the office of the presidency, he has degraded it — with words that a president has no business speaking (or tweeting); with ceaseless lies; with infantile and often unhinged behavior; with raging conflicts of interest; with managerial ineptitude; with a rapacious ego that’s never sated; and with foreign dealings that compromise America’s values, independence and interests.

And a second Trump term wouldn’t just be the sadly suboptimal byproduct of a noble stand; it would be disastrous. Morally as well as practically, limiting this unfit, amoral, unsteady man’s time in the presidency takes precedence over any small cluster of sentences written centuries ago. But while an impeachment’s impact on November 2020 is unknowable, its effect on us as a nation is almost certain.

Kudos to President Biden for putting the billionaires tax on the table as part of his budget proposal for fiscal 2023. As we’ve reported many times in recent years, a means of forcing the richest of the rich to pay their fair share of taxes has long been overdue.

The differences arise in part from where the tax would start and how it would be calculated.

Billionaire Leon Cooperman objected to Warren’s plan with profanity, and billionaire Elon Musk tried to tweak Wyden over his proposal, which like Biden’s targeted unrealized capital gains — that is, gains in the value of assets such as stocks and bonds before they’re sold. Wyden responded that Musk’s approach of turning tax policy into a game merely underscored the necessity of a wealth tax. So will this plan, especially because it takes direct aim at the capital gains tax, the favorite loophole of the wealthy.

The White House in September estimated that the 400 wealthiest families in America paid an average federal individual income tax rate of 8.2% on $1.8 trillion of income between 2010 and 2018. “A firefighter or teacher can pay double that tax rate,” Biden said in his budget statement Monday, citing the earlier estimate.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The latter has all but defined itself as an agent of the wealthy. Its latest position paper, the “Rescue America” plan issued by Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, called for raising taxes on the poorest American households. (Scott’s household net worth of about $220 million, by the way, would put him right in the target zone of Biden’s proposal.)

The reason is that capital gains, which enjoy preferable treatment in several respects, provide most of the income reported by the wealthy. The richer you are, the more of your income receives that happy treatment. In tax year 2019, the most recent for which the IRS published statistics, those with more than $10 million in reported income attributed 57% of it to net capital gains and dividends (which also receive preferential tax treatment).

For the wealthy group, the figure was only 17%. According to the Federal Reserve, the top 1% of households by wealth (a threshold that starts at about $11.1 million) own about 23% of all the corporate equities and mutual fund shares in the country; the bottom half of all households own a collective 0.7%. How do capital asset owners make out like bandits at tax time? Let us count the ways.

You’ll probably be hearing from water-carriers for the rich that taxing unrealized gains doesn’t compensate asset owners for their losses in down years.

In any event, Biden’s proposal would give the target households up to nine years to fork over what they owe on existing unrealized gains and five years to pay the tax on new income. That would “smooth year-to-year variation in investment income,” the fact sheet states. The coming debate over Biden’s tax proposal will probably focus in part on its constitutionality.

""The rapidly growing Democratic field has collectively moved so far to the left that it is about to fall off the edge of the political charts,"" writes Michael Tanner in National Review.

""Democrats now pushing many of the same socialist policies that destroyed Venezuela,"" reads the headline of another story on Fox's website. President Trump agrees that Democrats are becoming far too extreme: But there's a pattern developing: First, a Democrat proposes a new policy idea — such as Medicare-for-all or tax increases on the wealthy. Then Republicans say, ""My god, are you insane? If we do this we'll become Venezuela!""

Likewise, a 70 percent marginal tax rate on income of more than $10 million, which Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has proposed, garnered the support of 59 percent of respondents in one poll, which isn't too surprising given that taxing the rich more is consistently one of the most popular ideas in American politics.

But the point is that, on their face, these supposedly wacky socialist ideas Democrats are proposing are things Americans think are perfectly worthwhile. That's only part of the story, however. The fundamental premise of the conservatives' warnings is that when voters go to the polls next November, they'll be making an ideological judgment, and that if Democrats are too far from the center, they're guaranteed to lose. This is what political scientists call the Median Voter Theorem, which assumes that you can array both candidates and voters on an ideological scale from left to right, and the candidate closer to the median voter is the one who wins.

Ideology plays a part, but if it was just about aligning their positions with the median voter, Republicans would not have won the White House at any time over the last few decades.

So many of the issue positions Republicans hold — tax cuts for the wealthy, opposition to increasing the minimum wage, dismantling environmental regulations, loosening oversight of Wall Street, outlawing abortion, privatizing Medicare — are deeply unpopular. They understand this perfectly well, which is why they run shrewd campaigns built on identity, not ideology, and capitalizing on their voters' higher propensity to turn out.

Only in Washington would politicians scramble to pay for legislation they say costs nothing.

In the past few weeks, no fewer than three national news outlets (including this one) have reported, at some length, that Biden, a reliable moderate for almost a half-century in government, has been transformed into a revolutionary — their word, not mine — who is at this very moment plotting an FDR-style expansion of the federal government. As Biden might say: What a bunch of malarkey. The new narrative goes like this: Yes, Biden was a realistic reformer who proclaimed, as recently as his last debate with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), that people were looking ""for results, not a revolution.""

And what are these policies he'll rush to enact in his first 100 days? Should we expect Biden to propose a massive wealth tax like the ones proposed by his rivals, Sanders and Sen.

Which gives the campaign an opportunity to shore up support from Sanders and Warren devotees, who are thought to be less than jazzed about Biden. (Although, given the visceral contempt these voters have for Trump, I'm guessing the number of Democrats who would have voted for Sanders but will actually refuse to vote for Biden in November is probably about equal to the number of antifa members infiltrating protests right now.

Then he's going to put it back on the market in four years, having done the neighborhood a tremendous service.

The only recent periods when revenues were this high as a share of the economy were the economic boom of the late-1990s, and the roaring inflation of the Jimmy Carter years.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Spending is falling as a share of the economy now that the pandemic is easing. But it remains well above the modern-era average of 20.8%.

The other is five years older than Trump, prickly and humorless, has the socialist label and embraces the most extreme positions many in his party reject (e.g. allowing incarcerated mass murderers to vote). So far — to my ongoing amazement — Democratic primary voters tell pollsters they want the grouchy socialist, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), not Sen.

By virtually any measure, she's a more accomplished and more electable choice, yet it's Sanders who remains in the top tier of candidates. As Warren showed Monday night at a CNN town hall, she's obviously the candidate with the most detailed, specific policies — and the one most capable of explaining detailed plans. She also manages to be less frightening — but bolder — than Sanders. As to boldness, Sanders swore off pushing impeachment hearings now. Warren gave this impassioned plea: Three things just totally jump off the page. The first is that a hostile foreign government attacked our 2016 election in order to help Donald Trump. The evidence is just there. Read it, footnote after footnote, page after page documentation.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

So, here's how I see this: If any other human being in this country had done what's documented in the Mueller report, they would be arrested and put in jail. Obstruction of justice is a serious crime in this country. But [special counsel Robert S. Mueller III] believed because of the directions from Donald Trump's Justice Department that he could not bring a criminal indictment against a sitting president. I think he's wrong on that, but that's what he believed. So he serves the whole thing up to the United States Congress and says, in effect, if there's going to be any accountability, that accountability has to come from the Congress. And the tool that we are given for that accountability is the impeachment process.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It's not like it's going to take a long time to figure this out. It's there. It's got the footnotes. It's got the points. It connects directly to the law""). With specifics she is able to make her case quite compelling: ""He told the White House counsel to go fire Mueller, and then told the White House counsel to go lie about having told the White House counsel to go fire Mueller, and then told the White House counsel to write a letter saying that Donald Trump had not told him to go fire Mueller, and then to say, 'Why on Earth would you take notes about what I said to you? The lawyers I deal with never put anything in writing.'""

""Part one is that we say that we're going to roll back student loan debt for about 95 percent of students who have debt."" She continued, ""And part two is to make sure that we never get in this mess again on student loan debt and that is to make college universally available with free tuition and fees, and to put more money into Pell grants so that students of color, so that our poorest students have real access to college and that we put real money into our historically black colleges and universities. "" She's explicit about how to pay for it, without demonizing the rich: I started several months ago about a wealth tax, an ultra millionaire's tax. It's 2 cents on every dollar of the great fortunes above $50 million.

You've got to pay something back so everybody else gets a chance. And here's how the money works out. If we put that 2 cent wealth tax in place on the 75,000 largest fortunes in this country, 2 cents, we can do universal child care for every baby zero to 5, universal pre-K, universal college and knock back the student loan debt burden for 95 percent of our students and still have nearly a trillion dollars left over.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

""Nothing,"" he said, and on Tuesday he proved it by reproposing his Build Back Better agenda in different form. This includes more enormous tax increases that he couldn't get through even a Democratic Congress. Start with a reprise of his ""billionaire minimum tax."" This is a version of Sen. Elizabeth Warren's tax on wealth that voters rejected in the 2020 Democratic primaries. ""No billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a school teacher or a firefighter,"" the President said with no further explanation.

It would apply to households worth more than $100 million in accumulated assets, and its target is wealth. The version the President first proposed in his 2023 budget outline would claim a minimum of 20% from high earners' ""total income,"" a contrived term that includes unrealized capital gains on top of actual asset sales. This means that if your assets rise in value during a year, you will pay taxes on that increase even if you realized no actual gains through a sale. If you lack the ready cash, you might have to sell assets to pay the tax bill or pay later with interest. If your assets fell in value, you would not be able to deduct the full loss from your overall income. Heads the government wins, tails you lose.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The Sixteenth Amendment lets Congress tax income that is ""derived"" from a ""source,"" which implies a realization. In precedents going back to 1920, the Supreme Court has never found that the income tax applies to unrealized gains. New taxes like this also tend to expand beyond the low initial rates that their authors use to get them passed.

Chevron CEO Mike Wirth recently defended a $75 billion buyback after President Biden condemned the company for, well, turning a profit. ""We delivered on our financial priorities,"" Mr. Wirth said. ""Returning cash to shareholders, investing capital efficiently, and paying down debt."" A 1% tax is unlikely to stymie buybacks, but at 4% the disincentive bites harder. Companies might increase dividends as an alternative—at least until Congress raises the 23.8% dividend tax rate.

Mr. Biden said the enlarged buyback tax would ""encourage long-term investments"" instead of returns to investors. When it comes to Chevron and other energy companies, ""long-term investments"" is code for shifting money toward the green agenda. Mr. Biden wants more revenue because he's also proposing trillions of dollars in new social spending. The President pledged Tuesday to ""restore the full child tax credit,"" a benefit that Democrats temporarily raised to as much as $3,600 per child in 2021.

So why propose it? The answer is that this is what he plans to campaign on in 2024 and what he would try to pass in 2025 if he wins. His tax campaign will also help to deter a primary challenge from the political left, as the State of the Union cheers from Ms. Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders attest.

That's the optimistic view mouthed by Michael Reed, the CEO of New Media Investment Group, GateHouse's parent, on Nov. 14 after the deal was approved by shareholders of both companies. One would hope so, since the news business could use an injection of optimism these days.

""Since 2008, there hasn't been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,"" says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor.

Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it ""immaterial"") and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred. The private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can't escape the industry's economic challenges. Sacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry's coal mine.

McClatchy's parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times.

That deal closed in June 2018; Soon-Shiong remains a major shareholder of Tribune, with 24.4% of the company as of March 20.

For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that's where the news audience has been moving to. GateHouse hasn't been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm's practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to ""consolidate copy editing and page design"" at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters.

It shouldn't escape notice that it's not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with ""investing for growth."" The increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder.

This might seem counterintuitive, but: It bodes well for the republic that so many were eager to hear yet another of Sanders's harangues about the inequity of all existing social arrangements. They gathered in the borough of Queens, the incubator of presidents (well, of the 45th), to affirm that the Vermont senator should be the 46th.

Her persona, that of a hectoring schoolmarm, can be grating, but is less so than his, which recalls Dorothy Parker's description of Katharine Hepburn: ""She runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.""

Strain argues that most of us should want to increase the incomes of those at the bottom even if in doing so we raised the incomes of those at the top by a larger percentage because we should “care more about the absolute condition of those at the bottom than about the size of the rich-poor gap.” But “absolute condition” is influenced by social norms. Apart from those in dire poverty, people’s sense of their own standard of living depends on where they stand relative to others.

A fighter looks sharp until the first blow to the kisser. Then (as President Trump might say): Bye-bye. Can't take a punch. The glass jaw is a common feature among presidential candidates. How many times have we seen a good-looking governor or sapient senator enter the ring robed in shiny endorsements and muscled up with money, only to drop like a carton of eggs at the first gaffe or zinger? Elizabeth Warren's jaw ain't glass. Since hitting the canvas earlier this year, Warren has rallied, through a combination of hard work and big ideas. You see it in the poll numbers.

Warren's mother was determined to save the family home, and a minimum-wage job at a Sears catalogue center allowed her to do it. That was back when the government looked out for working-class people, she says. Warren actually undersells her biography. She tells her audiences that she dropped out of college to get married yet managed to earn a law degree while having two children.

That's when the whooping and clapping begins, and Warren launches into a jeremiad against corporate concentration: ""Big Ag"" — as in agriculture — ""Big Oil,"" ""Big Tech,"" ""Big Finance.""

A few years ago, a document called the Leap Manifesto was drafted by a group of Canadian environmentalists.

But things are different now. Today, the youth, both around the world and in Canada, have made climate justice a prevailing issue.

Not only does it commit to green objectives such ending fossil fuel subsidies, setting emissions targets, banning single-use plastics and incentivizing electric vehicles, but it also commits to a national retrofitting program that will affect all housing stock in Canada by 2050 and will help create an estimated 300,000 jobs.

This was all bolstered by last month's comprehensive platform announcement by Singh at the Ontario NDP convention. For Singh, the environmental plan formed only part of the pitch. It was a part of what Singh called a New Deal for People (sharing the party's acronym), aimed at uniting social, economic and environmental justice under one banner. This includes full drug decriminalization, lowering the voting age to 16, ending police racial profiling, committing to a partnership with Indigenous peoples and providing truly universal Medicare by closing gaps around access to medicine, dentistry and mental health care. All of this would be paid for by shifting away from fossil fuel subsidies and raising taxes on the richest people and corporations, including the creation of a 1 percent wealth tax on all individual wealth above 20 million Canadian dollars (just over $15 million).

One of the most striking findings in the CNBC/Burson-Marsteller survey is that corporations and the free market are viewed far more favorably in developing countries, where capitalism is just emerging, than in advanced countries. On a basic question, “How favorable are you toward corporations?” the general public in emerging economies was markedly favorable, 72-24, while those in advanced economies were far more ambivalent, 52-40. Strong majorities, ranging from 58 to 65 percent of those surveyed in emerging nations, agreed that corporations pay their fair share of taxes, help achieve equality and encourage the government to treat citizens fairly.

They seem mad mostly at the rich, who paid little in income taxes as a share of just their income and virtually nothing as a share of their net worth. In some cases, actually nothing. Some billionaires — reportedly including the owner of this newspaper! — paid zero dollars in income taxes during a handful of years. All as their fortunes swelled. Fume all you want, but the tax system is working exactly how it was designed to.

As a society, we could make different choices. There's a long menu of options to wring more money out of the very rich, including some good proposals from President Biden. Let's start with options that are popular but somewhat problematic. Many on the left love wealth taxes, such as those promoted by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass). She has proposed taking 2 percent annually of fortunes greater than $50 million (3 percent for wealth above $1 billion). While the idea polls extremely well, its constitutionality is questionable. The Supreme Court has struck down wealth taxes before; given the court's composition today, a different result seems unlikely.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

That's easy for publicly traded securities (such as Tesla stock), but for more illiquid assets (a closely held business, art collection, intellectual-property rights to Taylor Swift's song catalogue), valuation can be easily manipulated if no recent transaction has taken place. Implementing an annual wealth tax is therefore likely to be an enormous boondoggle for professional appraisers, and to leave the Internal Revenue Service vastly outgunned. Similar administrative headaches would occur if we annually ""mark to market"" the value of assets, another frequently proposed idea. This involves taxing not people's wealth, per se, but taxing their capital gains according to how much their assets grew (or shrank) each year, even if those assets never got sold.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

If there's a giant recession, and Facebook stock tanks, does Uncle Sam cut Mark Zuckerberg a check? So let's talk about some more promising ideas.

Right now, billionaires can fund lavish lifestyles by borrowing at low interest rates against their stock holdings and use this untaxed money to fund things such as mansions or yachts. A consumption tax would hit such purchases. Consumption taxes tend to be regressive, though, so other policy changes would be required to prevent hurting the poor. Then there's Biden's proposal to raise the top tax rate on capital gains, and more important, to change when such taxes get triggered. Right now, rich people can bequeath enormous estates to their heirs tax-free (up to a certain amount), and any gains their stocks or other assets have accrued over their lifetimes get wiped out at death as though they'd never happened, at least for tax purposes. Under Biden's plan, however, the tax code would treat gains above a certain threshold as ""realized"" whenever the owner dies or otherwise transfers the asset to someone else.

This idea, sometimes called a retrospective capital tax, was proposed some 80 years ago by Nobel laureate William Vickrey and has been developed further since. These kinds of changes would go a long way toward making sure those who live off their wealth pay their ""fair share,"" just as regular wage-earners do. They wouldn't guarantee that every billionaire's fortune gets taxed, particularly if we're unwilling to eliminate tax benefits for charitable giving. There are other ways for the well-heeled to legally duck the Tax Man, too.

In a revealing examination of tax records for 25 of the wealthiest Americans, the journalism nonprofit ProPublica reported Tuesday that some of the nation’s most prominent billionaires declared relatively little taxable income in comparison with the rapid growth of their wealth. Jeff Bezos, for example, added an estimated $99 billion in wealth between 2014 and 2018 but reported only $4.22 billion in taxable income during that period. Warren Buffett, who amassed $24.3 billion in new wealth over those years, reported $125 million in taxable income.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

An army of volunteers quickly rushed to the defense of the nation's billionaires, insisting that they can’t be faulted for following the rules. But it is not a coincidence that the United States uses a definition of taxable income that happens to be hugely advantageous for rich people.

2021-06-08	New York Times (Online)	The Real Tax Scandal Is What’s Legal	txt-opeds/2538661847.xml.txt	For tax purposes in the United States, income is basically defined as money. If an investment increases in value, that does not count as taxable income. The economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman estimated in April that the wealthiest Americans are holding about $2.7 trillion in wealth on which they have not paid taxes. The logic of this standard rests on a tripod of assumptions that aren’t true. The first is that an increase in asset value is in some sense unreal, or at least unusable. The Supreme Court established the standard in 1920, ruling that a woman who received some shares of stock didn’t need to pay tax on the value because the transfer of the shares “takes nothing from the property of the corporation and adds nothing to that of the shareholder.”	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

ProPublica provides the example of Elon Musk, who has pledged shares of Tesla stock worth $57.7 billion as collateral for personal loans. That provides Mr. Musk with plenty of spending money. Indeed, he apparently has relatively little need for conventional income. ProPublica reported that in 2018 he paid nothing in federal income taxes. The second and very common falsehood is that people will eventually pay taxes on their wealth — that they get to determine the timing but they do not get to avoid the taxman.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Assets can be siloed in nonprofit foundations whose main beneficiaries may be the people who run them. Assets can also be passed on to children and grandchildren. Better yet, the government allows heirs to take ownership at the present value, erasing the accumulated tax liability. Mr. Buffett is never going to pay taxes on the vast majority of his wealth. He is quite open about this, telling ProPublica that he believes it’s better for society for his fortune to be distributed as charity “than if it is used to slightly reduce an ever-increasing U.S. debt.”	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

There are difficulties, such as fixing rules for determining the value of assets. There also are downsides, such as the possibility that someone might have to sell an asset to pay taxes. But we know it can be done because Americans already pay property taxes, and it seems to work fine. Even for those who aren’t ready to jump onto the wealth tax bandwagon, the data obtained by ProPublica underscores the need for a significant overhaul of the system. The federal income tax is designed to be progressive, meaning that those who make more money are supposed to pay taxes at higher rates. But the richest Americans don’t. Public data shows that in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available, the top 0.001 percent of taxpayers — roughly 1,400 households — paid a smaller share of income in taxes than the rest of the top 1 percent. The effective tax rate for that elite group was 22.9 percent.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2021-06-08	New York Times (Online)	The Real Tax Scandal Is What’s Legal	txt-opeds/2538661847.xml.txt	According to ProPublica, the very richest Americans paid taxes at an even lower rate — just 13.3 percent of their taxable income in 2018. That was less than the median American household, which paid about 14 percent in federal taxes on about $70,000 in taxable income. For some, the effective tax rate was significantly lower. ProPublica reported that Michael Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, paid just 3.7 percent of income in taxes. The ProPublica story does not say that the rich broke any laws. For all we know, they all followed the law punctiliously. But it’s worth noting that we don’t really know, because the government has largely given up on verifying that the rich pay what they owe.	6	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

But none of those changes suffice to address the basic unfairness that the wealthy are living by a different set of rules, lavishly spending money that isn’t taxed as income. I’ve argued that the government should disclose the amounts that everyone pays in income taxes, just as it discloses property taxes.

The second is a deep struggle between the party's moderate and progressive wings. And the third is the quest to find a candidate who might be able to straddle both lanes. None of these parallel contests were resolved in the debates Tuesday and Wednesday nights. But the lines of the struggles became more clear. Mr. Biden was more forceful in this round of debates than he was in the first round last month, and, as a result, probably preserved his position as the front-runner. Certainly Mr. Biden was the frequent target of attacks from across the stage—over his record in pushing tough criminal-justice laws in the past, over his views about high levels of immigrant deportations while he was vice president, over long-ago statements about working women.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Mr. Biden was hardly sure-footed in every response, but he surely will emerge still as the top dog. The broader struggle between moderates and progressives spanned both nights of debates and reflects a deep split within about not just the character of the party, but also about the best approach for beating President Trump.

The moderate response is that the progressives are offering programs that will scare off voters the Democrats will need, even in a base election. Mr. Biden tried to drive that home on Wednesday night by saying that his more moderate health plan—which principally involves expanding the Obamacare program by expanding its coverage for the poor and allowing others to buy into the Medicare program if they choose—would cost a fraction of the progressives' government-run Medicare-for-all plans.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Indeed, the federal government is in the first year of what is forecast to be a four-year stretch of budget deficits topping $1 trillion annually. That is a torrent of red ink that raises serious questions about whether the country can afford the big plans Democrats are floating.

Warren endorsed a Medicare-for-all plan, which she suggested would be paid for through higher taxes for billionaires and corporations, and a $2 trillion climate-change program, which also would be funded through a corporate profits tax. She also said that by imposing a ""wealth tax""—a flat tax on the assets of those worth more than $50 million—the U.S. could finance universal child care, universal prekindergarten programs, universal free college, cancellation of student-loan debt for 95% of those who hold it, additional money for historically black colleges plus higher wages for every teacher and child-care worker in the country.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

And unless whichever one of them becomes the nominee can reach across this ideological and existential chasm, Democrats will face an uphill slog in November. For the better part of a decade, a significant core group of young Americans have been telling pollsters they prefer socialism to the only capitalism they’ve known: a financialized, globalized system that rewards the few and has done particularly poorly by them.

In Colorado, Biden won a mere 8% of the under-45s, while Sanders pulled down just 20% support among their elders. In California, Biden’s support among sub-45 voters came to a bare 9%; Sanders won only 22% of those over 45. Worse yet, those exit polls reveal a reluctance among a number of both Sanders and Biden supporters to vote for the eventual nominee should it not be their preferred candidate. Depending on the state, somewhere from 12% to 20% of the Democratic primary voters said they weren’t sure they’d vote for the party’s nominee.

The most he’s capable of, I suspect, is some tweaks in presentation. In making the case for Medicare for all, for instance, he could emphasize how he would expand Medicare’s coverage to dental and vision care, for which seniors now have to shell out. I’d bet, however, that such changes in emphasis wouldn’t turn many seniors’ votes. As the more likely nominee, Biden faces an even more urgent challenge in trying to win young people’s votes.

He should be. As a matter of policy, placing financial barriers before young people trying to build a life for themselves only stunts the economy, as well as those young people’s lives. As a matter of politics, tuition-free public higher education is wildly popular. Tuesday’s exit polls showed that 77% of Democratic voters in Texas, 73% in Tennessee and 66% in Virginia — all states Biden carried — supported the idea.

Biden needs to better align his I’m-for-ordinary-Americans-against-Wall-Street rhetoric with his actual policies.

Conventional wisdom holds that candidates appeal to their bases during the primary and then move to the center for the general election. But Biden has already cast himself as a moderate, and his strong Super Tuesday support in politically purple suburbs makes clear that he can win moderate voters, including, I’ll wager, the college-graduate Republican women who voted Democratic in 2018 and who are appalled by Trump’s total lack of decency and empathy — qualities Biden has in abundance.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

2020-02-21	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Opinion: Michael Bloomberg is finally having his moment with readers. Is that a blessing or a curse?	txt-opeds/2359791374.xml.txt	Consider this an update to a previous piece: Last November, about a week after media mogul Michael Bloomberg entered the Democratic primary, I noted that what set apart the reader reaction to the ex-Republican and former New York mayor’s campaign kickoff was that there wasn’t much of it. Did this suggest an expedited filing of the Bloomberg candidacy under “also-rans”? Perhaps not. Since then, Bloomberg’s billions have bought the candidate’s way first into our Facebook feeds, then into our political consciousness and finally onto the Democratic debate stage. Consequently, his presence on the L.A. Times’ letters page has increased, to the point that he was the most-mentioned Democratic candidate — which certainly does not mean most favored -- by our writers.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Is that a blessing or a curse?	txt-opeds/2359791374.xml.txt	Who knows if this means Bloomberg’s campaign will continue to ascend? Other Democrats who were for a time the greatest focus of our letter writers’ attention have dropped out (Sen. Kamala Harris), fallen far in the polls (Joe Biden) or are not even running (Rep. Adam Schiff), so there’s no way to tell. But what they all received was their moment on the L.A. Times’ letters page, and now Bloomberg is having his. Arthur G. Saginian of Santa Clarita said Bloomberg can’t beat Trump: What surprises me is that the Democrats who support Bloomberg think he can beat Trump simply by outspending the president, and that’s not even what this is about.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-02-21	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Opinion: Michael Bloomberg is finally having his moment with readers. Is that a blessing or a curse?	txt-opeds/2359791374.xml.txt	They don’t understand what Trump symbolizes and why people voted for him. Trump didn’t “buy” the election in 2016. He proposed a radical departure from the rules, and the people who voted for him wanted that. The Democrats simply cannot comprehend that. All the money in the world can’t beat an idea, and that’s why Bloomberg’s billions won’t beat Trump. Mission Viejo resident June Maguire echoed the concerns of readers concerned by Bloomberg’s wealth: Oracle’s billionaire chief executive recently held a fundraiser for Trump at $250,000, Amazon’s founder paid $165 million for another mansion, and Bloomberg has already spent more than $300 million on his campaign.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Every day, Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax proposal sounds more sensible. Al Nault of Irvine was one of several other readers who were fine with nominating a billionaire: Warren attacked Bloomberg by saying, “I’d like to talk about ... a billionaire who calls women ‘fat broads’ and ‘horse-faced lesbians.’” I’m sure I’m not alone in noticing that while Christian Republicans pay homage to the immoral Trump, progressive Democrats are demanding that their candidate be a saint. Why is it that running for president while also being rich is a bad thing? Franklin D. Roosevelt was a one-percenter, and he did very well for the citizens of this country.

Also, being poor or of modest means does not preclude having a heart of stone. It may be that Bloomberg will not win the nomination, but the Democrats should not set unrealistic standards and once again shoot themselves in the foot. Marilyn Perenchio of North Hollywood penned a rare letter defending “stop and frisk”: Why do robbers rob banks? That’s where the money is. Why did New York cops practice stop-and-frisk in certain neighborhoods? That’s where the guns were.

2019-02-06	The Washington Post (Online)	Live commentary on Trump’s State of the Union: Follow along with Post columnists	txt-opeds/2176618340.xml.txt	President Trump delivered his 2019 State of the Union address starting at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Washington Post opinion writers and cartoonist Ann Telnaes commented along in real time. See a transcript below; the most recent opinions appear first. Read the Editorial Board's reaction: Trump's State of the Union gave us the same old polarizing demagoguery — at length STEPHEN STROMBERG, 10:45 p.m.: I guess I shouldn't be surprised when President Trump makes a series of outrageous claims about illegal immigration, but it still somehow shocks me that the president of the United States can be such a brazen, unhinged fear-monger. His description of a ""tremendous onslaught"" on the ""very dangerous southern border"" is supposed to promote unity? It's not reality. It also continues to amaze me that Trump's immigration obsession takes up so much of his mental space — at least as measured by the number of words he devoted to it tonight. There is so much more the country needs to face — climate change, education, global competitiveness. Instead, he imposes crisis after unnecessary crisis on the country in service to his weird fixations. This presidency is one interminable own-goal.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Trump is due for an uptick in job approval — the shutdown is over, and when a long string of bad news cycles ends, he typically gains in the polls. If they mistakenly believe the (probable) bump is from the speech, they might make some bad strategic moves. E.J. DIONNE JR., 10:38 p.m.: I know what Trump was reaching for, but I liked it better in the original: ""Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado ..."" — The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But in my mind, it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind swept, God blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace — a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors, and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.""	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

What comes out in the governing has been the exclusionary filling of the sandwich, not the bipartisan overtures or patriotic paens on either side. I guess the proof will be in the eating, though. Mr. President: Prove me wrong. CATHERINE RAMPELL, 10:34 p.m.: Lots of people are observing how much of the speech was about the 1940s. Perhaps Trump sees that as the last time the country was united (... against Nazis)? CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:33 p.m.: Just kidding. But this was a far more temperate speech than the one I had braced for. I was intrigued by how often the speech looked forward into space or backward toward the Greatest Generation, a sense of history and uplift I don't usually associate with Donald Trump.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Controversial but peppered with humor. Strengthened by the inspiring stories of heroes young and old, President Trump and his supporters have to be very pleased with the State of the Union, the Democrats wholly unmoved, and the Americans in the middle perplexed by the apparent rejection by many in the chamber of what was once considered routine: American exceptionalism and abundant faith in the future. CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:33 p.m.: This is the night Trump finally became president. ALYSSA ROSENBERG, 10:32 p.m.: Nancy Pelosi said the House would be in order, and it largely was. In the end, the symbolism of the sea of white suits was far more powerful than any outburst could have been.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Trump ends his speech by alluding that America is a light unto the nations. Easily his best, and most Reaganesque, speech to date. CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:29 p.m.: ""Keep America First In Our Hearts"" is possibly an even worse slogan than the prior? MOLLY ROBERTS, 10:28 p.m.: A Gettysburg Address for our time, except opposite. CATHERINE RAMPELL,10:28 p.m.: I can think of someone who squandered his great inheritance. KAREN TUMULTY, 10:28 p.m.: ""Think of this Capitol — think of this very Chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery."" The Capitol was also built by slaves, which is part of our national shame.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:26 p.m.: Not petty at all. It's worth noting that every time the audience started paying attention to someone not him, he either frowned or tried to redirect back to himself. MOLLY ROBERTS, 10:24 p.m.: Trump says, ""They wouldn't do that for me,"" after an admittedly nice moment of Congress (tunelessly) singing ""Happy Birthday"" to a Pittsburgh synagogue shooting survivor. Am I petty to be annoyed that he made even this about him? HENRY OLSEN, 10:24 p.m.: What a wonderful touch, the survivor and the liberator sitting next to one another.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

He avoided military service and has had the cushiest of lives. And remember, this was the guy who said that there were good people on both sides when neo-Nazis marched in Charlottesville. KAREN TUMULTY, 10:21 p.m.: It's past mine. MOLLY ROBERTS, 10:20 p.m.: Surely it is past many of these lawmakers' bedtimes. DAVID BYLER, 10:20 p.m.: I tend to think this age gap on socialism polling has a lot to do with who was (and wasn't) politically conscious during the Cold War. But that's a tangent we can get into some other time.	7	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

KAREN TUMULTY, 10:20 p.m.: Longest SOTU in modern history (measured by time, not words) was Bill Clinton 2000, which clocked in at 1 hour 28 minutes. We are approaching a new record tonight. E.J.

Iran or Michael Jackson song?	8	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

But, interestingly, there's a big age divide there with younger generations generally feeling more positive about socialism. JENNIFER RUBIN, 10:12 p.m.: Great nations do not bail out and undercut negotiators. MOLLY ROBERTS, 10:12 p.m.: The sandwich is gaining layers! We now have an attack against ""socialism,"" which shows how much ground redistributive policy has gained in the Democratic Party. Trump's explicit condemnation of the Abolish ICE movement earlier was another example of this ""Overton window"" shifting — these have become serious enough debates now to merit mention in the State of the Union.	9	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

They were worried he would help the Maduro regime by blustering about military intervention. CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:11 p.m.: Loved that extended and anachronistic riff about fending off the Red Menace. As I've written before, there's a real generational (and political) divide in how the concept of ""socialism"" is understood. HENRY OLSEN, 10:11 p.m.: It was stunning to see how few Democrats applauded the line ""America will never be a socialist country.""

HENRY OLSEN, 10:10 p.m.: Trump's claim that we would have been at war with North Korea unless he had been elected was a blunder — and a blemish on an otherwise outstanding speech so far. HUGH HEWITT, 10:10 p.m.: Bravo President Trump for saluting President Guaidó and the people of Venezuela. I cannot believe Speaker Pelosi is sitting this one out. Ours is the Freedom Hemisphere.

How weak. CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:08 p.m.: (But who am I to criticize? Unlike some people, I didn't singlehandedly avert war with North Korea by the very fact of my election.) ALYSSA ROSENBERG, 10:08 p.m.: It's interesting that this is the first part of this speech where Trump has really alluded to his supposed prowess as a dealmaker. CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:07 p.m.: ""We will outspend others by far"" doesn't seem like the most thoughtful strategy. JACKSON DIEHL, 10:07 p.m.: The idea that we would be in a ""major war"" with North Korea without Trump is simply preposterous. It was Trump who risked war with his talk of ""fire and fury."" And the threat from NK nukes has not changed.	12	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

MOLLY ROBERTS, 10:06 p.m.: My sandwich analogy no longer holds up after the baby-execution segment, though maybe it'll end up being a double-decker. CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:06 p.m.: That intense segment on abortion, filled with movement phrases such as ""culture of life,"" seems like a very calculated attempt to appeal to his evangelical and religious base. The president might as well start cultivating that again, as his support elsewhere begins to peel away.

CHRISTINE EMBA, 10:02 p.m.: Oof, this segue from paid family leave to ""executing a baby"" is ... aggressive. CATHERINE RAMPELL, 10:01 p.m.: Trump says his new budget will reflect a commitment to eliminate HIV. His previous two budgets proposed HIV funding cuts. ERIK WEMPLE, 10:01 p.m.: When was the last time President Trump spoke for nearly an hour without bashing the media? Just wondering.

The same YouGov poll I referenced earlier said 24 percent of Democrats think health care is the most important issue. YouGov asked about a large battery of issues in that question, so the 24 percent number is pretty striking. MOLLY ROBERTS, 9:57 p.m.: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell does not look enthusiastic about taking on big pharma. Thankfully, plenty of Democrats are — and Trump could work with them to actually get something done.

That, and his trade policy more generally, are big pluses for him going into 2020.

(Re: Christine's comment) CHRISTINE EMBA, 9:49 p.m.: And the Dems are using his ""USA"" chant against him — and he is NOT pleased. ALYSSA ROSENBERG, 9:49 p.m.: The great irony of these employment numbers for women is that they're exactly the kind of things Men's Rights Activists like to cite to say that men are the ones who are truly oppressed. I actually think that there's a really interesting political platform to be built around these shifts in gender roles, but the Trump administration is never in a zillion years going to be the one that actually makes all of those connections.	18	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

CATHERINE RAMPELL, 9:48 p.m.: We have more women in the workforce than ever before because there are more women alive than ever before. Women's labor force participation rate peaked in 2000. DAVID BYLER, 9:48 p.m.: Also worth noting Gallup published some polls showing the majority of respondents opposed ""significantly expanding the construction of walls along the U.S.-Mexico border.""

E.J. DIONNE JR., 9:46 p.m.: Trump's call for an end to division consumed a lot less time than his divisive, inflammatory, hyperbolic and fear-inducing rhetoric about immigration. ALYSSA ROSENBERG, 9:45 p.m.: Oh, so a ""a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier"" is the hot product Trump's pushing now, not some lousy old concrete wall. The slipperiness of Trump's evolving rhetoric here will never cease to amaze me. HUGH HEWITT, 9:45 p.m.: The president's remarks on the dangers posed by the southern border going unsecured are powerful and are made more so by the presence of victims. It will be a flashpoint for the debates of tomorrow on whether such rhetoric is divisive and destructive or necessary and illustrative. Where you sit determines what you see. If the conference committee does not produce a compromise this is a debate that will intensify for the next two years.	20	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

First mention of the wall. About 40 minutes into the speech. JACKSON DIEHL, 9:44 p.m.: We're hearing two speeches — the thin sheen of ""unity"" rhetoric proposed by his political advisers — and the familiar hardcore demagoguery of a Trump rally. It's easy to tell which bits Trump actually authored. CHRISTINE EMBA, 9:44 p.m.: ""I will never abolish our heroes for"" ... mice? I know he's trying to push back at the ""Abolish ICE"" meme that has gained traction on the left, but that line came out very garbled.

(His tax cut may help them pay for all three!) Is his border wall is a form of wall redistribution? GREG SARGENT, 9:41 p.m.: It's remarkable to watch Republicans applauding Trump's demagoguery on immigration. Right now, they are frantically scrambling to figure out how to avoid either another government shutdown or a declaration of a national emergency. They don't know how or whether they can't meet Trump's wall demand, and have no clear way out.

Ilhan Omar has her head in her hands and looks legitimately pained as Trump sings the evils of immigration from Mexico. CHRISTINE EMBA, 9:38 p.m.: Trump has a consistent fascination with these women and girls who are supposedly being smuggled across the border — perhaps taped up with duct tape? — to be sexually assaulted and then sold into prostitution. Rumors of white slavery have a long history, and it's bizarre how often — and in how much detail — he references this trope.

The negotiations over border security and immigration reform will get their paragraphs, as will a review of President Trump's policy triumphs — especially the tax cuts and economic boom — but if his theme is freedom for Venezuela and the world, he can't go wrong.

Some polls find young American adults prefer socialism to capitalism, and self-described democratic socialists Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York congresswoman, and Bernie Sanders, a Vermont senator, have captured the hearts and minds of many Democrats.

Every country is a little bit socialist insofar as every government owns some productive assets. Until the 1980s, government ownership in strategic industries such as telecommunications, energy, and transportation was commonplace. Venezuela was no exception: In 1976, like many developing countries, it nationalized the oil industry with the creation of state-owned PdVSA. It was, until the 1990s, relatively well run. Though Mr. Chávez denied he was a socialist when first elected president in 1998, he soon radicalized, says Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan government official and now an economist at Harvard University who supports regime change. Soaring oil revenue in the 2000s enabled Mr. Chávez to embark on a sweeping nationalization of the economy. The government ""expropriated six million hectares of land, the steel sector, cement sector, supermarkets, telecoms, banks, dairy factories, coffee processing factories, hotels, and essentially ran all of them into the ground,"" says Mr. Hausmann. It imposed controls on prices, imports and foreign exchange, which in effect expropriated the cash flow of private companies.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Venezuela's socialism, which was heavily influenced by Cuban communism, isn't just a disaster; it's unique. Despite the region's long history of left-wing populism, no Latin American country has since followed Venezuela's path. Nicaragua, Bolivia and Ecuador have left-wing governments allied with Venezuela, but ""all have free trade, private ownership and a market mechanism,"" says Mr. Hausmann. Under former President Rafael Correa, Ecuador did force foreign oil companies to renegotiate contracts under threat of nationalization. But unlike Mr. Chávez, Mr. Correa couldn't finance a massive expansion of the state by printing money: Ecuador gave up its own currency for the dollar in 2000. Inflation averaged just 3.8% during Mr. Correa's 10 years in office, noted Sebastian Edwards, an economist at the University of California at Los Angeles.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Ms. Ocasio-Cortez has proposed a top income-tax rate of up to 70%, where it stood as recently 1981. Moreover, thousands of corporate executives already face an effective tax rate of up to 70% , noted Adam Looney of the Brookings Institution. That's because under Republicans' 2017 tax bill, corporations may no longer deduct executive compensation over $1 million, which in effect exposes executives to the 21% corporate tax rate, on top of their individual taxes. Similarly, Ms. Warren's proposed wealth tax is simply a broader (and probably less efficient) way to tax rich people's wealth than estate and property taxes.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

If the federal government ends up financing significant expansion of renewable energy under a Green New Deal, it wouldn't be unprecedented: it created the Tennessee Valley Authority in the 1930s and the Interstate highway system in the 1950s because their social benefits didn't lend themselves to private investment. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez goes further, proposing the Federal Reserve finance those investments, which would either compromise its control of inflation—or fail to save the federal government any money and thus be pointless.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Then came Donald Trump. Let’s start with first principles. SPACs, or special purpose acquisition companies, are shell companies that collect funds from investors on the expectation that they’ll find a private company to merge into within a given period of time, usually 24 months. It is never a good idea to invest in a SPAC just because someone famous sponsors or invests in it or says it is a good investment.

By mid-year, the thrill appeared to be over. Since the end of the first quarter, only about 300 more SPACs have come to market, according to SPAC Research. More saliently, investors have been pulling their money out of SPACs at an increasingly high rate. In the SPAC model, investors can bail, or “redeem” their investments, once a target has been identified. The average redemption rate in the latest quarter exceeded 50%, up from 10% at the start of the year.

Wall Street is enticing investors with SPACs — funds that won’t say what they’re buying.

Some Democrats never stop trying to raise taxes. It seems addictive. Never mind that Californians already pay the highest state taxes in the nation. Moreover, Sacramento is hauling in so much revenue that the state government is accumulating a huge surplus and is close to being legally forced to return some of the money to taxpayers.

Many, with no obvious succession strategy, will simply sell their companies, the backbone of Main Street economies across the country, to large corporations. All too often the result will be consolidations, plant closures and lost jobs for the people who helped build and sustain their companies for decades. The boomers should think again: selling to their employees is often a far better way to go — for both moral and economic reasons. Take New Belgium Brewing, based in Fort Collins, Colo., which its chief executive and co-founder, Kim Jordan, sold late last year to its 400-plus employees through what’s called an employee stock ownership plan. “There are few times in life where you get to make choices that will have multigenerational impact,” she said. “This is one of those times.”	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The trust uses that money to buy the owners’ shares, either all at once or over time. To ease the burden of such a large purchase, the employees, through the trust, can buy the company by borrowing against future earnings, with zero upfront costs. For many owners, the decision isn’t just about securing a legacy. It is a relatively easy one to make on financial grounds, too. If the owner sells more than 30 percent of the company to the employees, all capital gains taxes are deferred, provided that the proceeds are invested in American companies.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Indeed, three million more individuals are now worker-owners of their own businesses than are members of unions in the private sector. They include well-known companies like W. L. Gore & Associates, the maker of Gore-Tex, and the school-picture company Life-Touch, as well as countless smaller companies, some even organized as traditional co-ops. Most employee-ownership plans are not the result of boomer-age retirements, at least not yet. But that could change soon. Martin Staubus, a consultant for the Rady School of Management, at the University of California, San Diego, estimates that every year 150,000 to 300,000 businesses owned at least in part by boomers become candidates for employee takeovers as their owners hit retirement age.

The selling price and continuing value of the firm, for instance, depend on an independent fair-market valuation of the company. This can fluctuate depending on the state of the economy, potentially playing havoc with employee wealth. Tax benefits provided to help transfer ownership have also sometimes been misused. And ESOP’s involving large companies can be mind-bogglingly complex. But for smaller, privately owned companies, the challenges are typically well known and easily overcome. And while there is in theory some tension about the idea of worker-owners and worker representation through unions, many labor organizations are by now well versed in negotiating potential conflicts — indeed, the United Steelworkers recently decided to actively promote unionized co-op worker-ownership efforts.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

2020-03-06	New York Times (Online)	Where’s Joe Biden’s Universal Child Care Plan?	txt-opeds/2372374949.xml.txt	The issue is getting more attention than it has in decades, except from the Democratic front-runner. In her parting remarks to her staff this week, Elizabeth Warren took a moment to talk about the lasting mark her candidacy had left on the race. “You know, a year ago, people weren’t talking about a two-cent wealth tax, universal child care, canceling student loan debt for 43 million Americans while reducing the racial wealth gap or breaking up big tech,” she said. “And now they are.” She’s right — particularly about child care. Ms. Warren led the pack by putting out a groundbreaking proposal for public child care last February; Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg eventually followed suit. Three candidates with universal child care plans may not sound like all that much — but consider that before this race, no major candidate running for the White House had mentioned universal child care since the 1970s. That three top-tier contenders had competing plans demonstrates that this issue is an increasingly salient one for American voters. Child care is also an increasingly dire crisis facing the country — one that demands an equally aggressive response.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2020-03-06	New York Times (Online)	Where’s Joe Biden’s Universal Child Care Plan?	txt-opeds/2372374949.xml.txt	Of course, two of those contenders have left the race; the Democratic primary has essentially narrowed to a two-man contest between Mr. Sanders and Joe Biden. But where is Mr. Biden’s plan for how to address the broken child care system American families face? Without one, he risks being out of step with this historic moment. It wasn’t so long ago that the notion of not just universal child care but publicly run universal child care was downright mainstream. The United States has had such a system in place before: During World War II, as men were shipped off to fight abroad and women were called to work in factories, President Franklin Roosevelt funneled funding from a wartime infrastructure bill to creating and running a network of child care centers. They cost about $10 a day in today’s dollars for 12 hours of care year round, and the quality was high. They attracted qualified, trained teachers and had low child-to-teacher ratios.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-03-06	New York Times (Online)	Where’s Joe Biden’s Universal Child Care Plan?	txt-opeds/2372374949.xml.txt	Mothers loved them. In exit interviews in California, women gave them a nearly 100 percent satisfaction rating. They also improved children’s education, employment and earnings later in life, while increasing how much their mothers were able to work. But while child advocates lobbied to keep the program in place after the war, President Harry Truman shut it down as soon as Japan surrendered. The idea of enacting a federally funded universal child care system didn’t disappear, however, and it nearly became a fixture of American life in the 1970s. As more women entered the paid work force, and research started to coalesce around the importance of early education for children’s development, Congress drafted legislation in the late 1960s that would create a federally funded but locally administered network of child care centers.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

He himself had called for “a national commitment to providing all American children an opportunity for healthful and stimulating development during the first five years of life.” The legislation passed in 1971. Then Nixon did a 180 at the behest of his special assistant Pat Buchanan, who told me in 2014, “My view back then was that it was philosophically out of the question for the Nixon administration to support a major new welfare program.” Nixon issued a scathing veto that called it “family-weakening” and “truly a long leap into the dark for the United States government,” comparing it to communism.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The 1980s and ’90s were consumed with stories of satanic rituals at day cares and studies claiming that child care would ruin children. Even as recently as 2016, the Republican Party platform initially opposed universal preschool because it “inserts the state in the family relationship in the very early stages of a child’s life.” But it’s an issue that policymakers can no longer afford to ignore. The cost of child care has increased nearly exponentially in recent decades, far outpacing inflation. Now it consumes more of the average family’s budget than health care, transportation or food, and in most places it rivals housing, too. Full-time center care often costs more than tuition and fees for public college. That money still doesn’t buy quality, though. A 2006 survey found that fewer than 10 percent of American day care centers provided high-quality care. And that’s for the families lucky enough to get their child a spot: More than half of Americans live in a neighborhood without enough child care seats for all the children who need them.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Amy Klobuchar sponsored the Child Care for Working Families Act, a Democratic proposal in Congress with similar aims of universal coverage. Mike Bloomberg’s early-education plan supported higher-quality and lower-cost child care and universal preschool. Even President Trump has talked about child care, proposing on the campaign trail to increase tax deductions to cover the cost and calling for a one-time $1 billion investment in his White House budget. This is a vast, complicated crisis that is dampening our entire economy.

And while today he supports an increased child tax credit that can help families cover the cost, he wrote an op-ed article in 1981 arguing that the credit subsidizes the “deterioration of the family” and “encourages a couple” to “evade full responsibility for their children” by helping them put those children in day care. The article argued against any universal government child care assistance because it would go to well-to-do families, but it also repeated language from Republicans who fearmongered about child care.	6	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

But with the economy improving, there was less focus on the continuing need to address flagging incomes, rising inequality and unbalanced government spending. Below are 10 charts to illustrate the crosscurrents of the past year in economics and politics: By the end of 2014, even the most hardened cynics had to concede that the darkness that had pervaded the American economy since 2008 had lifted a bit. Most visibly, the rate of job growth accelerated, from 194,000 per month in 2013 to 241,000 per month in 2014. By May 2014, the total number of jobs had run past its previous peak in early 2008. Meanwhile, the overall economy began to expand at faster annual rates — 4.6 percent in the second quarter and a remarkable 5.0 percent in the third quarter.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2014-12-30	New York Times (Online)	The Year in Charts	txt-opeds/2212857502.xml.txt	An autumn collapse in oil prices brought more good news. A barrel of oil that fetched $107 in June commanded only $55 by Dec. 22. For consumers, that meant gasoline prices that fell to an average $2.38 per gallon, compared with their peak of $3.70 in April. All told, the drop in oil prices was equivalent to an annual tax cut of about $750 per American family. And with the United States still importing an estimated 26 percent of its petroleum, lower prices raise the economy’s growth rate and reduce the balance of payments deficit. Economic news was not all positive. Most important, there were only hints that stagnating wages might finally be turning upward. November figures showed that the cash pay of hourly workers rose by a slender 0.8 percent after adjustment for inflation over the previous year. The picture is modestly better when cash benefits are added to the equation. In the past two years, median family incomes, including items such as pensions, Social Security and unemployment insurance, edged up to about $53,500 from $52,600 in 2012. But they have remained well below their previous peak of $57,500 in January 2008. The decline between 2009 and 2012 was the first time this inflation-adjusted measure had dropped during an economic recovery.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2014-12-30	New York Times (Online)	The Year in Charts	txt-opeds/2212857502.xml.txt	Not surprisingly, stagnant wages contributed to rising inequality. In September 2014, the Federal Reserve released a study showing that between 2010 and 2013, only the top 10 percent of Americans saw their incomes increase. Depressingly, incomes for lower- and middle-class Americans fell the most. The news by occupation was similarly discouraging: Wages for manufacturing workers fell by 2.2 percent from January 2010 to November 2014, with those for autoworkers dropping by 11.7 percent. Lower-wage jobs in leisure and hospitality also saw pay fall. Perhaps not surprisingly, higher incomes accrued to those in finance, education and health, and other professions.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2014-12-30	New York Times (Online)	The Year in Charts	txt-opeds/2212857502.xml.txt	Happily, the problem of income inequality was brought front and center by the publication of the economist Thomas Piketty’s landmark book, “Capital in the 21st Century.” Originally written in French, weighing in at 696 pages and laden with incomprehensible equations, the book nonetheless spent 22 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, including three weeks at the top. While Mr. Piketty’s solutions, such as a global wealth tax, were mostly impractical or ill advised, his meticulous identification of the problem was unassailable. By 2012, a mere 0.01 percent of American households — earning an average of $21.5 million annually — commanded a near-record 4.1 percent of all income, compared with 0.5 percent when income inequality hit its trough in 1973.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2014-12-30	New York Times (Online)	The Year in Charts	txt-opeds/2212857502.xml.txt	The federal government does far less to ameliorate the disparities than the governments of other developed countries. As measured by the Gini coefficient (the higher the number, the more unequal), inequality in the United States is no worse than in most developed countries when calculated without regard to taxes and transfer payments such as Social Security, unemployment benefits, food stamps and the like. But because social programs in European countries are so much more expansive, inequality in the United States tops the list. The rush to cut government programs will only exacerbate this disparity. After a website meltdown in late 2013, this year brought proof that the Affordable Care Act was delivering on its promises: More than 11 million previously uninsured Americans are now covered by a health care plan, about half of them Medicaid recipients at the bottom of the economic ladder. Another 16 million Americans who were previously insured also signed up — many of them had substandard plans that were upgraded as a result of the A.C.A.

In fact, a statistical analysis of 10 key Senate races shows that the president’s low popularity ratings explain about 65 percent of the vote shares achieved by these individual Democratic candidates. In Arkansas, where President Obama’s approval rating was only 34 percent, the incumbent, Mark Pryor, received less than 40 percent of the vote. Weak candidates in states like Kentucky and Louisiana underperformed their predicted vote share.

Today, 94 percent of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican, compared with 70 percent back in 1994. Similarly, 92 percent of Republicans are to the right of the typical Democrat, compared with 64 percent 20 years earlier. This is reflected in a Congress that is also more polarized than it has been in at least 100 years, as measured by the voting records of individual legislators. Greater polarization is at least one of the reasons for gridlock on Capitol Hill that remained at least as bad in this Congress as in the prior one. As of Nov. 30, the Congress that will depart at the end of this month succeeded in passing only 186 public laws, many of them minor or simply ceremonial.

Schultz, who enjoys a net worth in excess of $3 billion, huffily told NPR on Tuesday that Sen.

When an interlocutor heckler called Schultz a ""egotistical billionaire a**hole,"" and suggested he ""go back to Davos,"" the group booed.

PHOTO: Salgu Wissmath for The Wall Street Journal California's Legislature is considering a wealth tax on residents, part-year residents, and any person who spends more than 60 days inside the state's borders in a single year. Even those who move out of state would continue to be subject to the tax for a decade—a provision that calls to mind the Eagles' famous ""Hotel California"" lyric: ""You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave."" The California Constitution probably allows a statewide wealth tax on residents, but any effort to create a tax capable of reaching across state borders is likely to run afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Taxing someone who spends only 60 days in the state in any single year—and extending that tax over an ensuing decade—would be something new under the sun.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

The range of people it proposes to ensnare is staggering: every student attending college in California, anyone having a major medical procedure at a California hospital and needing an extended in-state recovery period, and those who spend two months in California away from New York or London winters. Under California tax law, there is no distinction between a nonresident from Minnesota and a nonresident from Dubai. Assembly Bill 2088 proposes calculating the wealth tax based on current world-wide net worth each Dec. 31. For part-year and temporary residents, the tax would be proportionate based on their number of days in California. The annual tax would be on current net worth and therefore would include wealth earned, inherited or obtained through gifts or estates long before and long after leaving the state.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

It would grab a scientist who develops a drug to cure cancer years after leaving California. A grandchild who spent a single summer surfing in Southern California would be subject to the tax.

Another proposal—to increase the top state income-tax rate to 16.8%—would annually raise another $6.8 billion. Today, California's wealthiest 1% pay approximately 46% of total state income taxes. Adding the wealth tax to individual taxes and including those taxpayers who have abandoned California, the combination of the two proposals would have 1% of the state's population paying about 53% of individual taxes. California has enough financial woes for an entire large nation. Most are of its own making, including unfulfillable public pension promises and a vast social safety net beyond the capacity of California's workers to fund. So the Legislature looks to the wealthiest Californians to fill funding gaps without considering the constitutionality of the proposals and the ability of people and companies to pick up and leave the state, which news reports suggest they are doing in large numbers. The very act of collecting the financial information necessary to calculate the A.B. 2088 wealth tax would be an invasion of privacy.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

While the rate appears negligible and the $30 million base seems high, it is a slippery slope. In California, tax rates rarely get lower. The state's top income-tax rate was 9.3% in 2003. Soon it could be 16.8%. Why 0.4% instead of 1%, 2% or 10%? Why not a $10 million base? Even at 0.4%, there are eye-popping new levels of actual tax. Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg would face a first-year tax of approximately $400 million. If he moved out of state immediately, his total wealth tax over the subsequent decade would be another $2 billion. If he remained in California, the wealth tax would extract $4 billion over that decade.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

While the tax would diminish each year if he stayed out of the state, he would continue to be subject to a tax on his world-wide net worth for another decade. The cost of compliance by taxpayers and the cost of enforcement by the state would be monumental. For most taxpayers, the cost of compliance would far exceed the amount of the tax. A resident with a net worth of $31 million would be subject to a wealth tax of $4,000. The cost of an annual appraisal of each of that taxpayer's assets could easily exceed $100,000.

Her standing in the polls has fallen after missteps over Medicare, but she is still in the top candidate tier. Her ideas deserve to be taken seriously because they show where the American left wants to go: • Wealth tax: Tax net worth over $50 million at 2% a year, and 6% above $1 billion. To prevent the rich from yachting off, add a 40% ""exit tax"" on assets over $50 million upon renouncing U.S. citizenship. Estimated revenue: $3.75 trillion over a decade from 75,000 households.

Courts might also find the tax unconstitutional. • Medicare for All tax: Charge companies with at least 50 workers an ""Employer Medicare Contribution,"" equal to 98% of their recent outlays on health care, while adjusting for inflation and changes in staff size. These varying fees ""would be gradually shifted to converge at the average health care cost-per-employee nationally."" Estimated revenue: $8.8 trillion over a decade. If receipts fall short, add a ""supplemental"" tax on ""big companies with extremely high executive compensation and stock buyback rates."" • Global corporate tax: Raise the top business rate to 35%. Apply this as a world-wide minimum on overseas earnings by U.S. companies. Businesses would ""pay the difference between the minimum tax and the rate in the countries where they book their profits."" Apply a similar minimum tax to foreign companies, prorated by the share of their sales made in the U.S. Estimated revenue: $1.65 trillion over a decade.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Ms. Warren says this would have raised $10 billion over the past decade, although it probably runs headlong into the First Amendment's right to petition the government.

But his plan surely provides enough incentive for the next generation of entrepreneurs to find other locales to build their fortunes. Thank goodness there's a giant asterisk on the Sanders plan to achieve his dream of a country without billionaires. The Sanders plan is not constitutional, for the same reason that Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax is unconstitutional. The founders banned such direct taxes and the 16th Amendment only authorized the taxation of incomes, not balance sheets. Team Sanders seems to know this because to make its case the campaign is appealing to the authority of law professors—but ones that are making political rather than legal arguments.

Each candidate will have different goals, depending on his or her recent performance. The one candidate with momentum, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), has the benefit of appearing with very congenial contenders unlikely to attack her (e.g. Beto O'Rourke, Sen. Amy Klobuchar). Without another top-tier contender on the stage, Warren can dominate the debate, outshining the rest in a low-stress environment. Her biggest challenge is to explain how her panoply of policy plans is financially and politically feasible. What if her proposed wealth tax doesn't bring in enough money? What if all Republicans and a few conservative Democrats shoot down her domestic agenda?	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Their goal is to debunk the perception that they have lost momentum and to pleasantly surprise audiences that are expecting them to show weakness. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been falling in the polls, even slipping behind Warren. As Nate Silver put it, ""if I were putting my own money down — we're pretty early, but I would sooner have money on Warren than on Sanders."" When Sanders is pushed or feels pressured, he can lash out — a big no-no in a primary where Democrats have little patience for the proverbial circular firing squad.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Defending himself without being defensive, showing that he's a 21st-century candidate while citing decades of experience and demonstrating that he's moderate enough for moderates but progressive enough for progressives might all be a tall order. Now is the time, however, for Biden to put minds at ease and stop the flow of bad news stories. Two factors work in his favor: the deep affection that Democrats feel for him and the heavy price that opponents who attack him might pay. A week ago, we would have put South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the same category as Warren, a rising star. However, a South Bend police officer's fatal shooting of a black man, coupled with Buttigieg's inability to soothe angry African American residents, has underscored his difficulty in drawing African American support. Sunday might have been the worst day of Buttigieg's political career. The New York Times reports: Though many in the crowd clapped politely for Mr. Buttigieg, the meeting was dominated by members of the audience who loudly yelled their objections to the event's format and to the mayor's answers. When Mr. Buttigieg talked about the city's requirement that officers use their body cameras, someone called out, ""Why haven't you been enforcing it, then?"" When the mayor defended his record of engaging residents on policing issues, another person shouted, ""We don't trust you.""	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

He listened to complaints about a pattern of police mistreatment of black people. He admitted failures. He promised to do better. But at the same time, there was little of the soothing emotional empathy that politicians strive to deliver in such moments. How Buttigieg addresses this incident specifically and his larger problem with African American voters might determine whether he continues to occupy the top tier of candidates. This might be one problem that even his masterful TV performances cannot solve. Then there are the candidates for whom political extinction remains the most likely result of their presidential runs. If better-known figures (e.g. Klobuchar, O'Rourke, Sen. Cory Booker) cannot outshine candidates ahead of them in the polls, their chances for political survival diminish. If lesser-known and improbable candidates (e.g. John Delaney, Andrew Yang, Bill de Blasio, Rep. Eric Swalwell) don't have a career-best performance with a viral moment, they might sink into oblivion.	3	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

She had arguably the best kickoff of any candidate and possesses raw political talent second to none. Nevertheless, she has not broken into the top tier. Too cautious? Lacking specificity? No one has exactly put his or her finger on the issue, but Harris took it up a notch this weekend with excellent performances at the Friday fish fry hosted by Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), at her speech and then MSNBC interview at the South Carolina Democratic Party convention and then at a Planned Parenthood Action Fund forum. She was fiery. (""I know how to take on predators.

I am proposing something called accountable capitalism. You may remember that, for more than a century, American corporations owed multiple duties. They owed duties to their investors, but also to their employees, to their customers, to the communities where they were located, to our country. And then, in the late seventies, an economist comes along and says, ""Hey, here's a novel idea. How about if you only owe any kind of duty to your investors?"" Which means, make it all about profitability. That means that American corporations today, these giant corporations, they have no loyalty to America or to American workers.	1	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Your friend Deval Patrick, the former governor, worked at Bain Capital. When he got into the race the other day, he said he thought the Obama campaign had given a bum rap to Bain when he was running against Mitt Romney. This is a part of how business works; some deals go bad, but it's not a bad thing. Do you think he's right? Is Bain Capital and what it represents in the economy a bad thing? Elizabeth Warren: When they're trying to tweak up corporate actions that are already aiming only toward increasing profitability, perfectly willing to, if they could save a nickel by moving a job to a foreign country, would do it in a heartbeat — that is a problem in our economy. Even Jamie Dimon says so. Others who come in and help them do that, that's not making our economy work any better and it's not making our country work any better.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

If what they were helping do is make that company work better for employees as well as shareholders, for the communities where they're located as well as shareholders, then sure. But that's not what they're doing. So anyone who works in consulting is a bad guy so long as capitalism does not meet her accountability standard? Sounds like it.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), as she did in condemning South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's fundraising from big donors, something she would have to do in the general election unless she plans on unilaterally disarming against President Trump. And that points to Warren's second problem: Sanders. The New York Times reports that ""with Mr. Sanders enjoying a revival after his heart attack in October and Ms. Warren receding from her summer surge but wielding a formidable political organization in the first nominating states, it's increasingly clear that their biggest obstacle to winning the Democratic nomination is each other."" Nevertheless, neither wants to attack the other, which right now is hurting Warren more since she is sliding in the polls and struggling to explain her position on health care: Until she unveiled her own, more gradual implementation plan — after weeks of saying ""I'm with Bernie"" on Medicare for all — Ms. Warren had carefully guarded her left flank to avoid handing Mr. Sanders any fodder.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Her pivot on health care, along with the support she enjoys from a handful of billionaires, represents the best opportunity to diminish liberal enthusiasm for Ms. Warren, say Sanders supporters. Warren's unwillingness to challenge Sanders might make her predicament worse — and permanent. Aside from ideology, this echoes the dilemma that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) faced in his presidential run against then-candidate Donald Trump. He refused to take on Trump for fear of offending his followers; as a result, Trump waltzed to the nomination ridiculing Cruz every step of the way. The lesson: If you do not challenge the person who holds most of the voters you need, you are not going to win.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Instead of being the not-as-crazy-as-Sanders choice for progressives, she comes across lacking the qualities that helped her rise during the summer months — candor, high-mindedness, authenticity and intellectual consistency. But don't count her out. In a campaign with four to five top competitors (each with distinct bases of support), proportionate distribution of delegates and plenty of money to keep all of them going, the race might turn into a long slog. It's possible Warren might endure thanks to her remarkable work ethic, robust fundraising and organizational strength.	6	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Having two far-left, old, white candidates might be a recipe for total disaster. A ticket that is doubly scary to moderate voters, has little appeal to African Americans and hails exclusively from New England sounds like the Republicans' dream opposition. No, Warren's best hope rests in finding a comfort zone that is not quite as extreme as Sanders (one she can comfortably inhabit without being defensive), avoiding needless, petty fights with others and maybe even stressing her actual accomplishment in setting up the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, giving her claim to some executive experience and showing her ability to get something done.

On one side of the divide are those whom the political scientists Pippa Norris and Ronald Inglehart describe in a 2016 paper as comfortable with “an inexorable cultural escalator moving postindustrial societies steadily in a more progressive direction.” This new direction amounts to what the authors call an intergenerational shift toward post-materialist values, such as cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism, generating rising support for left-libertarian parties such as the Greens and other progressive movements advocating environmental protection, human rights, and gender equality.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Economic distress, they argue, reinforces cultural alienation to produce fertile terrain for Trump. “Fears of economic insecurity, including the individual experience of the loss of secure, well-paid blue-collar jobs, and the collective experience of living in declining communities of the left-behinds” combine to make voters more susceptible to the anti-establishment appeals of authoritarian-populist actors, offering simple slogans blaming “Them” for stripping prosperity, job opportunities, and public services from “Us.”	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

In their book, “ Cultural Backlash: Trump, Brexit and Authoritarian Populism ,” which comes out later this week, Norris and Inglehart write that Trump has assumed leadership of this authoritarian movement, defined as a cluster of values prioritizing collective security for the group at the expense of liberal autonomy for the individual. Authoritarian values prioritize three core components: 1) the importance of security against risks of instability and disorder (foreigners stealing our jobs, immigrants attacking our women, terrorists threatening our safety); 2) the value of group conformity to preserve conventional traditions and to guard our way of life (defending “Us” against threats to “European values”); and 3) the need for loyal obedience toward strong leaders who protect the group and its customs (“I alone can fix it,"" “Believe me,” “Are you on my team?"").	2	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

It may not be an either/or question, but one of relative emphasis with interactive effects. In this country, the nominally class-based politics of the New Deal fractured when working class non-college whites felt abandoned by a Democratic Party that shed its pre-civil rights, segregationist southern wing and that by the 1970s had adopted a culturally and racially liberal agenda.

Trump, Feldman noted, taps into some fundamental issues in contemporary American politics — race/ethnicity, social issues, nationalism — and his rhetoric — clearly designed to appeal to his base — turns off many of those who are not with him on those issues.

To a great extent yes, though the answer to that will depend in part on who the Democratic candidate is. As we saw in 2016, negative reactions to Hillary Clinton contributed to the outcome of that election. Feldman’s point about Clinton leads to the next question.

It’s playing right into the president’s hands. Gerald Seib, a columnist at The Wall Street Journal, wrote earlier this week that “Democrats have arrived at a moment of great opportunity, but also of great peril.” Increasingly, he argued, the party has become identified with policy proposals that are easy for Republicans to caricature as left-wing extremism.

Democrats could appear to be succumbing to the national mood of anger, when the better image might be of hope.

Executives, board members and big investors in drug companies — jockeying for government grants in the rush to develop a coronavirus vaccine — were rapacious. As shares soared on hints of progress toward a vaccine, the Boston Globe reported last week, insiders cashed in more than $1.3 billion in stock (compared with just $74 million over the same period last year). Consider what this means: Taxpayers cover the initial investment costs and expenses of tests, development and distribution of a vaccine. Executives capture the profits if the treatment is successful and pocket obscene sums along the way even if trials fail.

Disproportionately employed in ""essential"" jobs or positions that required their physical presence, their ranks have suffered outsize numbers of illnesses and deaths. Without union support or adequate health and safety protections, many were forced to work even when employers refused to implement reforms. Women have been disproportionately affected by the absence of day care or in-person schooling and have been forced to leave jobs to care for their families.

If you saw her just a few months ago, you would have been impressed by how she weaves her personal story into her policy objectives, the ease with which she can explain a complex problem in simple and direct language, and her skill in presenting lots of individual ideas under a big theme (give ordinary Americans a chance). Well, she has gotten even better. For one thing, she's not telling exactly the same story. Sure, she tells how her mother had to get a minimum-wage job at Sears after her father had a heart attack. But we also hear about her three brothers in the military and her non-linear life and career. She has gotten ""looser"" and funnier. She interacts with the crowd more.

If we do all that, we can make progress in a bunch of other areas. There were a few striking things about her Los Angeles appearance. First, she said virtually nothing about health care in her presentation. For all the time and energy that have been taken up on Medicare-for-all, it was not in her three-part agenda. In the Q & A, she began her response to a health-care question by reminding the audience about the House's vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act: ""What kind of people high-five one another over taking away health care from millions of Americans?"" She reminded the audience about Republicans' efforts to take away Medicaid, which pays for everything from addiction treatment to nursing home care.

In either case, she seem very much aware of how easily Democrats can be thrown on defense against a president who tried to eliminate the entire ACA. Second, she doesn't run on gender specifically (vote for me — I'm a woman!), but much of her agenda revolves around education, health care and child care — all issues that matter a great deal to women. Moreover, in a lighthearted way, she recalls experts who told her not to have so many plans and to ""smile more"" (a typical put-down directed at serious women).

Inside of a week, the Chicago hedge-fund manager who recently dropped $238 million on a 24,000-square-foot New York City penthouse has been featured in no fewer than three news articles. The purchase set the record for most expensive home sale in the U.S., so it's certainly newsworthy. But does it warrant a 1,700-word front-page article? And a second thousand-word story the following day? That depends on if you share the editors' progressive agenda. The Gray Lady informs us that Mr. Griffin is worth around $10 billion, collects expensive art, and owns other pricey properties in the U.S. and abroad. A generous philanthropist, he's given away nearly three times as much money as he spent on his new residence. But the paper also wants us to know that he ""has declined to join other billionaires in a pact to donate a majority of their wealth to charity"" and that ""critics"" consider him ""especially tone deaf"" for ""spending so freely at a moment when populist movements are gaining momentum around the globe."" For good measure, we're told that the penthouse has been constructed on the site of a former rent-stabilized building. Apparently, the reader is expected to blame New York's affordable-housing troubles on Mr. Griffin and his ilk, not idiotic rent-control regulations that discourage developers from building middle-income apartments.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The Times has shoehorned Mr. Griffin into yet another rant about stingy billionaires, income inequality and the supposed need for tax increases to expand the welfare state. A separate article even compares him unfavorably with a previous generation's ultrarich, ""who had a prevailing sense that too much was distasteful."" Examples include Brooke Astor, who ""lived, until her death, in an apartment on Park Avenue that was not in excess of 5,000 square feet,"" and David and Peggy Rockefeller, who raised six kids in an Upper East Side townhouse that measured a mere 10,000 square feet.

Oil refining made the Rockefellers rich, but in the process, they made oil products much cheaper and thus more widely available to the poor. Prior to Standard Oil, whale oil and candles were a luxury that only the wealthy could afford. The rest had to go to bed early to save money, explains Burton Folsom, a professor of history at Hillsdale College. ""By the 1870s, with the drop in the price of kerosene, middle- and working-class people all over the nation could afford the one cent an hour that it cost to light their homes at night.

Wealth creation plays a far bigger role than philanthropy or government transfer programs in improving our standard of living, something that those forever trying to ""stick it to the rich"" either don't understand or choose to ignore out of political expedience. Convinced that more affluent members of our society have succeeded at the expense of the poor, progressives are insisting that Democrats make income inequality a campaign theme in 2020.

The gap must also be closed from the bottom up, by bolstering access to the three key ingredients of middle-class wealth: owner-occupied homes, which represented the majority of household wealth for most people in 2019; financial assets, such as stocks, whose value, measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, has increased sevenfold since 1989; and human capital, in the form of training and education, which is highly correlated with household wealth. Seven out of 10 Americans in the wealthiest 10 percent have at least a bachelor's degree, according to the Federal Reserve, but only 1 out of 5 members of the least wealthy half of society does.

This is Canada's largest deficit since World War II. The fiscal ""snapshot"" — an update on the state of the country's finances, short of a full accounting — indicates that for the first time in its history, the country might see its debt surpass 1 trillion Canadian dollars ($744 billion) by 2021. Days later, the story was displaced from the headlines by the WE scandal — a now-canceled contract between a charity and the federal government that was quickly mired in controversy after it was discovered that the organization has paid members of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's family for speaking engagements. The WE scandal deserves attention, but not at the expense of other issues. Canada's fiscal situation merits sustained attention and scrutiny as well.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

But moving beyond that, a few considerations explain the necessity of the spending, temper concerns and point toward some ways Canada can move forward inclusively and sustainably. Governments around the world are spending during the covid-19 pandemic in an effort to keep individuals employed and businesses open. Spending is central to the strategy of attempting to put the economy into stasis and buy time. A third of a trillion dollars in deficit spending is, plainly, not ideal. A depression, just as plainly, is worse.

Ottawa banks are recording record-low interest rates, which makes carrying it less of a burden than if rates were higher.

And we are still in much better shape than the crisis levels of the 1990s, when Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio hit 66 percent. At this time, Canada's debt-to-GDP ratio will rise to around 38 percent. With careful planning, that is manageable. But Canada is in mid-moment, and the variables that will condition the ultimate outcome of this spending are still to be determined.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

And the provinces and territories can control reopening plans. Prudent plans will see jurisdictions reopen slowly, based on the best evidence available and best practices known. Diligent compliance will make those plans sustainable — and bearable. This is especially true as we consider a potential second wave of infections, and as case numbers in Canada begin to increase once more. Next, the pandemic is a challenge, but also a critical juncture — as are the deficit and debt. This is a moment where things can, and in some cases must, change. Above all, Canada must resist the temptation to implement austerity measures, which can do harm in the short and long term. Indeed, past austerity measures might have exacerbated the effects of the pandemic. Beyond that, the government ought to consider new revenue by way of a wealth tax and tackling offshore tax havens used by wealthy individuals and firms, as well as by tackling tax-dodging.

Instead, he is rather tentatively dipping his toes in the water of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, seeking to gently guide his party in the direction he thinks it should move. And it may cause some tension among the Democratic candidates as they seek to win the affections of a party for whom Obama is still a hero. Last week, at a meeting of Democratic donors, Obama offered what sounded like a criticism of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.

""The field will narrow, and there's going to be one person, and if that is not your perfect candidate and there are certain aspects of what they say that you don't agree with and you don't find them completely inspiring the way you'd like, I don't care,"" Obama said Thursday.

Obama has refused to endorse a candidate in the primaries, no doubt to the consternation of Joe Biden, who would love nothing more than to have his former boss' imprimatur. But this seems like the appropriate role at this stage of the process for the party's most beloved figure: to encourage unity without weighing in to the conflicts gripping the party as the primaries proceed.

And it's not only because, as David Swerdlick argues, Obama is in many ways — in policy, in perspective, in temperament — a conservative. That's one of the ironies of the Obama presidency: Despite his center-left policy agenda, Republicans regularly described him as an ideological radical who wanted nothing less than to tear the entirety of American society and government to shreds so that something unrecognizable and horrifying could be built in its place. Their argument was cynical, of course, meant to characterize anything to the left of the GOP as a socialist nightmare.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

No matter how much Obama ruled as an ordinary, even moderate Democrat, Republicans never stopped calling him a wild-eyed fanatic. Even as his presidency was coming to a close, Marco Rubio famously suggested that Obama ""knows exactly what he's doing,"" meaning the smoldering wreckage that was America in 2016 was not the result of Obama's incompetence but the poisonous fruit of his project to destroy the country.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Even the ""moderate"" candidates, for instance, have proposed health care reforms centered on a comprehensive public option, something Obama couldn't include in the Affordable Care Act after opposition from Democrats like Joseph I.

Warren's core argument — that this is the time for ""big, structural change"" — is a kind of unspoken rebuke of Obamaism, to the extent such a thing exists. It not only rejects his incrementalist approach; it assumes that the things he accomplished were insufficient. It says we can't just undo the last four years and return to how it was when Obama was in office, which is what Biden proposes.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is this: She failed, but she failed in an impossible feat. The feat was getting the math on Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vt.) specific version of Medicare-for-all to add up. Which means: offering more generous coverage than currently exists anywhere on Earth in a country that likely has the highest health-care prices and still somehow saving the country money in the process.

That would require him to document his claim that middle-class Americans will come out ahead financially even if their taxes go up. As he told CNBC's John Harwood recently: ""You're asking me to come up with an exact detailed plan of how every American — how much you're going to pay more in taxes, how much I'm going to pay. I don't think I have to do that right now."" Warren, on the other hand, has cast herself as more than a mere Overton-window-expander.

""Medicare-for-all"" is a popular brand, sure, but it's a vague slogan that means different things to different voters. And polling suggests Sanders's particular interpretation of that slogan, which includes eliminating private insurance, is not actually a political winner. Plus, as Warren herself persuasively argued back in January, there are ""lots of paths"" to get to universal health coverage, which is the broad objective voters care about. These paths don't all require shunting everyone onto single-payer. In fact, there are ""lots of paths"" to get to single-payer that don't look like Sanders's specific version of single-payer. These include considerably cheaper proposals that — as in the existing Medicare system — have some modest cost-sharing, such as through income-based premiums.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Yet — perhaps to chase the Sanders voters who have made supporting his ""damn bill"" a purity test — she still decided to hitch her wagon to his idea. So, Warren did Sanders's homework for him. And she determined that in order to pull off Sanders's promises, you need to make some extremely generous assumptions. On both sides of the ledger. On the cost side, Warren takes existing, independent estimates for how much money a given proposal would save and then ratchets them up much higher. For instance, the Urban Institute recently estimated that a single-payer system might cut drug costs by 30 percent from commercial prices. Warren instead suggested she'd cut payment rates for branded drugs by more than double that.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

""They're making more optimistic, more aggressive assumptions."" On the revenue-raising side, Warren likewise proposes some ideas that might be good on their own merits, but then dramatically overstates their impact. Increasing the enforcement budget of the Internal Revenue Service, for example, is a no-brainer for raising tax revenues. But Warren's plan says it would raise 40 times as much money as the Congressional Budget Office estimates. Likewise, however little sympathy you might have for the billionaires subject to her 6 percent annual wealth tax, the Warren team's projections for how much money it'd raise beggar belief, given foreseeable tax evasion and avoidance. Eventually she's going to run out of billionaires to tax, and she'll have to reach into pockets further down the income ladder.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Which is strange, because until recently, I thought it was indeed the Democrats who cared about practicing good math. The peculiar thing is this: If you stripped away the most inflated, least convincing assumptions in Warren's proposal, it could in fact raise enough money to get us to universal coverage without a single-payer system. Heck, we could even pay for a version of single-payer that looks more like merely expanding the existing Medicare program to all Americans — a proposal the Urban Institute has dubbed ""single-payer lite,"" and that has income-based cost-sharing and Obamacare-style minimum benefits.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Let's concede that higher deficits are one problem that can't be blamed on President Trump. Since the 1970s and 1980s, Democrats and Republicans alike have evaded the hard questions required to balance the budget.

Instead of cutting spending or raising taxes, successive presidents and Congresses have covered the gaps by borrowing. Since 1961, federal deficits have occurred in all but five years (1969 and 1998-2001). Even these materialized only at the end of the long economic booms of the 1960s and late 1990s. By the end of 2018, the federal debt held by the public — the total of all past annual deficits — was near $16 trillion, equal to 78 percent of the economy (gross domestic product, or GDP).

Politically, the appeal is obvious: something for nothing. Politicians can dispense new spending or tax cuts without paying for them through offsetting tax increases or spending cuts. Meanwhile, government's activities have mushroomed, financed mainly by declines in defense spending. In 1960, military outlays represented 52 percent of the total federal spending. Now, they're 15 percent. In their place are health-care programs (Medicare, Medicaid and Obamacare), expanded Social Security, the FBI, the Environmental Protection Agency and more. Americans have gotten used to Big Government while paying only for smaller government. One reason that this has — so far — worked is that the dollar is the world's major currency for international trade, investment and personal saving. People take refuge in it. Lending and borrowing in dollars create a global demand for the currency. It's easy for our government to borrow at low interest rates.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

But when the Penn Wharton Budget Model did an independent analysis, it estimated that the 10-year revenue would be only $3.3 trillion, a 24 percent drop from Sanders's forecast. Worse, this estimate disregards the effects of the new tax on the economy.

With interest rates now so low, this doesn't seem a problem — which is why it is. Second: The truly scary possibility is a run on the dollar.

The crowd was gathered in Washington by the president with the specific intention of intimidating members of Congress (and the vice president) to abandon their duties and support a coup against the Constitution.

And she's happy to mock or insult the billionaire class along the way. That is what differentiates her from many other Democrats. While Warren proposes some deeper changes to corporate structures than many other candidates do, when it comes to taxing the wealthy her positions are only a slightly more elevated version of what most Democrats stand for and have for some time.

While we've anticipated battles over whether Biden goes far enough in a progressive direction on health care and climate, one issue that hasn't gotten as much attention — but that is profoundly important — is tax reform. With their ""law and order"" demagoguery having failed miserably, the Trump campaign is now saying Biden will destroy the economy by raising everyone's taxes. Which is, of course, false. The truth is that there's a lot to like in Biden's tax plan; in many ways, he's going further than President Barack Obama did, one more indication of how Biden has been pulled in a progressive direction as the Democratic Party has moved left.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Biden is taking a grab-bag approach to tax policy, tossing out a dozen different proposals that are perfectly worthy but might fall away as the complex machine of legislation grinds its gears. He may get some of it passed, but probably not all, and the result could be a series of incremental adjustments to tax rates that will be easily reversed the next time a Republican president takes office. But let's give him credit where it's due. In the primaries, Biden's tax plan was contrasted with those of Sens.

Second, he will absolutely, positively not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. You can see the political logic. The Trump campaign will repeat the lie that Biden wants to raise everyone's taxes approximately 28 bazillion times, so the Biden campaign wants to reassure people that everything will be fine for you, unless you're rich. What he actually proposes is a range of increases on corporations and the wealthy: Raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent; require a minimum tax on overseas corporate earnings; raise the top marginal income tax rate back to 39.6 percent; eliminate the ""stepped-up basis"" loophole that allows people to inherit investments tax-free; cap the amount of tax deductions the wealthy can take; impose payroll taxes on high incomes.

But there's one more Biden proposal that represents the real missed opportunity: He says that investment income should be taxed at the same rate as wage income — but only for those making over $1 million a year. As a revenue-generator, it's a great idea. The problem is that it's buried in the grab bag, when it should be the centerpiece of Biden's tax agenda. And it should apply to everyone, not just the super-rich. Right now, investment income (money you make when your money makes you more money) is taxed at a lower rate than wage income (money you make by working).

Instead, like Biden is doing, they propose to close a loophole here and increase a tax rate there, while leaving in place the fundamental inequity of the system. I've asked Biden's campaign why he proposes finally taking the step of equalizing the treatment of wages and investment income, but only for people who make over $1 million a year.

Biden could say that this one of his fundamental principles: All income should be taxed the same. No more loopholes, no more preferential treatment for the rich. You worked, you have investment income, you got an inheritance? It's all taxed the same. It's easy to understand, and it can guide the writing of legislation.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The court ruled that since the voters had merely expanded an existing program 一 Medicaid 一 the GOP legislature is required to implement it. We've seen similar citizen-driven efforts succeed in expanding Medicaid over GOP opposition in six red states since 2017.

Under the expansion, the federal government pays 90 percent of the cost of extending Medicaid to non-senior adults who earn up to 138 percent of the poverty line. That's a great deal 一 it essentially funds virtually all the cost of a state expanding health insurance to huge numbers of its poor residents 一 but a dozen states have still refused. So the ARP added an additional sweetener. Under it, if a holdout state opts in, the federal government adds an additional 5 percentage points of matching funds for two years 一 not just on its Medicaid expansion population, but on its entire existing Medicaid population.

But again, the state's own residents are getting health insurance as a result. The bottom line is that this stands to be a pretty big windfall. And the court decision is what's compelling this over the opposition of GOP legislators. ""With the incentive in the American Rescue Plan, the state will actually make money by expanding for two years,"" Levitt told me.

In contrast with former vice president Joe Biden, who has said that President Trump is a historical ""aberration,"" Warren grasps how systemic corruption, which took root over the course of many years, created the conditions for Trump's election. (For example, she has introduced anti-corruption legislation in the Senate to ""padlock the revolving door between big business and government."") And she's offering a powerful, populist vision for ending American plutocracy. That vision is clearly resonating with voters. Today, the candidate with supposed ""electability issues"" is drawing large, energetic crowds. While she remains behind Biden and Sanders, she is gaining in the polls and earning respect from people Democrats lost, either to Trump or to apathy, in 2016. A recent focus group of Trump voters in Iowa showed strong support for Warren's policies, while a BlackPAC poll conducted in April found her in third place among black voters, with especially high favorables among those following the race closely. Far from being a divisive presence, as some predicted, Warren is showing how a bold, progressive agenda can be a unifying force.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Such a shift is happening right now with the country's two major political parties. Both Republicans and Democrats are in the midst of—and in fact, may be near the end of—significant realignments that are altering who they are and what they stand for. This realignment was on display in the results of both the 2016 and . Yet, as we're seeing in the current policy debates in Washington, the parties haven't caught up with their own new realities. In fact, they are facing a kind of identity crisis, in which they are pushing policy prescriptions that aren't really in tune with their changed rank-and-file membership.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Now they have veered off in dramatically different directions. Last fall, college-educated white women favored Democrats in House races by 33 percentage points, while white men without a college degree favored Republicans by 42 points. These two groups also are rough proxies for Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump voters in the 2016 presidential elections. As the rank-and-file has shifted, so has the geographical center of the two parties. Among Republicans, New York liberals and California conservatives once coexisted as powerful internal blocs. Indeed, since World War II, Republicans five times picked a presidential nominee from California (Richard Nixon three times, Ronald Reagan twice), and had a serious California contender as late as 1996 in former Gov. Pete Wilson. Twice they chose New York's Thomas Dewey.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The party is weak on the two coasts, and is centered in the interior of the country. Democrats, meanwhile, regularly nominated presidential candidates from the heartland and the South—Missouri's Harry Truman, Texas' Lyndon Johnson, South Dakota's George McGovern, Georgia's Jimmy Carter, Arkansas' Bill Clinton, Tennessee's Al Gore. Each of those states has since turned Republican red. The problem for the two parties is that these changes are creating some ideological and policy whiplash. Republicans, traditionally dominated by business interests, used to be the party of free trade and open movement of workers across borders.

And can the party that considers climate change an existential threat really speak to the coal miners and auto workers that used to form part of its core constituency?

Kamala Harris, Cory Booker—play more to the new, progressive, millennial version of the party.

Appealing to the New Deal era, Mr. Piketty proposed a simple explanation and remedy for rising economic inequality: The concentration of income among the top 1% could be mitigated by strategically targeting wealth with the tax system. Mr. Piketty based his theory on a historical argument taken from his own empirical work with fellow economist Emmanuel Saez. When Congress and President Franklin D. Roosevelt hiked the top marginal income-tax rate to 91% during the New Deal and World War II, they allegedly broke up the concentration of the capital stock at the top of the income ladder. Inequality declined to a midcentury trough, where it remained until the Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s. Inequality then rebounded to form a centurylong U-shaped pattern. The solution, then, is to restore tax rates to their FDR levels.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

That's the main conclusion of a new analysis of top income concentration in the U.S. between 1917 and 1960, which we recently published in the Economic Journal. Progressives embraced Messrs. Piketty and Saez's historical account after it appeared in an influential academic paper in 2003. Their story undergirds the wealth-tax proposals of Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Heather Boushey, a member of President Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, is also a fan. Even the New York Times's ""1619 Project"" draws on Messrs. Piketty and Saez to proclaim confidently that ""progressive taxation remains among the best ways to limit economic inequality.""	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It's true that income inequality declined in the early part of the 20th century, but the cause had more to do with the economic devastation of the Great Depression than the New Deal tax regime. To see how, we must first turn to Messrs. Piketty and Saez's inequality statistics. Their data show a rapid decline in top income shares between the 1929 stock-market crash and the end of World War II—a period economists have dubbed the ""Great Leveling."" In their version, the sharpest decline took place between 1940 and 1945, just as the 91% top marginal rate schedule became a fixture of midcentury tax policy. Their statistics imply that more than 34% of the decline in the top 1%'s income share occurred in this brief period, as did an astounding 73% of the decline in the top 10% of earners.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2022-04-11	Wall Street Journal (Online)	Inequality and the Piketty Accounting Error; The stock-market crash, not high FDR-era taxes, caused the 'great leveling' of the middle 20th century.	txt-opeds/2649111750.xml.txt	Our investigation of the Piketty-Saez data reveals that they failed to account properly for historical changes in how the Internal Revenue Service reported income-tax statistics. As a result, their numbers systematically overstate the levels of top income concentrations by as much as a third, while also distorting the trend line during the ""Great Leveling"" period. The combination of these errors creates an illusion that FDR's tax hikes caused inequality to fall. Messrs. Piketty and Saez's mistakes arise from how the IRS tabulates income. Between 1943 and 1944 the tax collection agency shifted from tracking ""net income"" to ""adjusted gross income,"" or AGI. The latter category, a truer depiction of annual earnings, includes both taxable earnings and deductible income such as charitable giving and state and local tax payments. Yet Messrs. Piketty and Saez didn't bring pre-1944 IRS records into line with AGI accounting standards. Instead, they applied a fixed and arbitrary adjustment to all years before the AGI accounting change that conveniently scaled upward to the highest income brackets.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Piketty and Saez mishandled how they estimate the top 1%'s income shares. In addition to IRS records of tax payments, this calculation requires a measure for all personal income earnings. We found that in every year prior to 1960, the IRS's numerator is mismatched to the total income denominator used by Messrs. Piketty and Saez. They used the wrong accounting definition for personal income and neglected to adjust their data for wartime distortions on tax reporting. When we corrected these problems, something stunning happened. The overall level of top income concentration flattened, and the timing of its leveling shifted away from the World War II-era tax rates that Messrs. Piketty and Saez place at the center of their story.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

In our series, inequality rose between 1917 and 1928, confirming the ""Roaring '20s"" boom. The crash of 1929 emerges as the precipitating event of the ""great leveling""—mainly due to severe capital losses among the wealthy during the Depression. These events predate the alleged inequality-reducing effects of high progressive taxation. The first Depression-era income tax hikes weren't enacted until 1932. The policies that Messrs. Piketty and Saez wish to emulate became permanent during World War II, when Congress expanded federal income-tax eligibility and aggressively ramped up enforcement through automatic payroll withholding.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It's possible that FDR-era tax policies contributed to a leveling that was already under way, but these effects are muted in comparison with what Messrs. Piketty and Saez assume. When combined with other revisions to questionable claims in the post-1960 portion of the Piketty-Saez inequality data, a different centurylong pattern emerges. Instead of an inequality U-curve, in which income concentrations sharply fall then rise again as a direct inverse of federal income tax rates, we find a pattern that resembles a shallow saucer. Inequality does change over time, but at a much more subdued level. The causes of the shifts are related to macroeconomic events, such as the Depression, and conventional economic factors, such as increased labor and capital mobility.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Let's get that out of the way right at the beginning. He does, however, care about using anti-Semitism as a political tool. He uses it as a weapon against Muslim Americans who criticize him, and he uses it to reinforce his commitment to a particularly vicious right-wing form of Zionism, which cheers his evangelical Christian base. That's the proper context to understand an executive order Trump planned to sign Wednesday, one that turned out to be not quite as controversial as it first appeared but still raises a host of questions.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

But it still serves an important symbolic function in a complex swirl of issues, which include the many kinds of bigotry Trump has encouraged and a long-running campaign to discredit pro-Palestinian activism. On Tuesday, administration officials told reporters that the order would define Judaism as a ""nationality"" for the purposes of enforcing anti-discrimination law on campus, which would enable enforcement under Title VI, which does not mention religion. This reporting led to a great deal of criticism, particularly since the idea that Jews constitute a separate nation has long been used to question their loyalty to the country where they live.	1	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The key question will be how it is applied in practice."" The order does, however, say that in enforcing anti-discrimination law, the government will ""consider"" the definition of anti-Semitism adopted in 2016 by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, which contains elements easily cherry-picked to serve one's purposes. For instance, that definition says ""criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic."" But it also says that ""denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g., by claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor"" is anti-Semitic.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

This gets to the heart of how accusations of anti-Semitism can, in the wrong hands — and the Trump administration is definitely the wrong hands — be used to stifle free speech, especially when they circumscribe criticism of Israel. Someone might apply double standards to Israel out of anti-Semitism, but the idea that doing so is inherently anti-Semitic is preposterous. We can decry double standards, but people use them all the time in policy debates without being defined as bigoted.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

If you're criticizing China or Russia or England or Iran on campus, you can be selective in your evidence, employ double standards or otherwise make shoddy arguments without running afoul of the government, but only when you criticize Israel must you be scrupulously fair or else you're being anti-Semitic? Yousef Munayyer, the executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights, pointed out to me that the person in charge of enforcing civil rights on campus for the Department of Education — the one whose responsibility it will be to implement this order — is Ken Marcus.

Now he's on the inside playing the role of enforcer,"" Munayyer told me. ""There's no doubt that anti-Semitism is on the rise. It's terrifying,"" Munayyer added, but ""I don't think this addresses anti-Semitism helpfully in any way. It's not about that. It's about providing cover for Trump's own anti-Semitism and the anti-Semitism from his supporters, and it's also an effort to shut down Palestinian rights activism on campuses.""

""You have to vote for me,"" he said, because ""you're not gonna vote for the wealth tax."" Trump regularly asserts that Jews do and ought to have unquestioning loyalty to Israel (he refers to Benjamin Netanyahu as ""your prime minister"" when talking to Jewish audiences) and describes Jews as greedy, money-grubbing, conniving schemers who only want to horde wealth and power. In other words, he sees Jews as having the same repugnant character flaws as he does, which is why he can be an anti-Semite who regularly praises Jews. As Yair Rosenberg pointed out, ""Trump believes all the anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews. But he sees those traits as admirable.""	6	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-12-11	The Washington Post (Online)	Executive order controversy shows why it’s impossible to trust Trump on anti-Semitism	txt-opeds/2324715006.xml.txt	It's no coincidence that Trump's election was celebrated by neo-Nazis everywhere. That doesn't necessarily mean that any action he takes on anti-Semitism is by definition bad. But it does mean we should be deeply suspicious. And given that Republicans (and some Democrats) have for years engaged in a campaign to discredit Palestinian rights, it's hard to think that even an executive order that appears not to change the law in any meaningful way won't be used in the wrong manner. So the best we can say about Trump's executive order is that maybe it will make no difference. Maybe it won't be used to stifle pro-Palestinian activism. Maybe universities won't be spooked into censoring students. Maybe this won't be twisted into a tool to move us further toward the kind of society Trump is trying to create, one gripped by fear and driven by hatred. Let's hope so.	7	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It calls for a reversal of the Trump administration's partial rollback of the 2010 Dodd-Frank banking regulations, and a restoration of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's initiatives to crack down on payday lenders and ban mandatory arbitration in financial services contracts. He even endorsed a financial transactions tax, something long despised by Wall Street. The proposals are good and needed. But one could be forgiven for being more than a bit skeptical that Bloomberg will lobby hard for these changes if he becomes president. See, Bloomberg's entire modus operandi, up until the past few weeks, wasn't to criticize Wall Street. Instead, he offered aid and succor to it at almost every possible opportunity.

Not only is the financial community beyond unapologetic for its role in the 2008 financial crisis — the one that Bloomberg's own release points out cost each and every American about $70,000 — many Wall Streeters are meeting calls for greater regulation, increases in the social safety net and higher taxes on their wealth with insults and invective.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Instead of taking responsibility for the fact that almost 8 million homes went into foreclosure during the financial crisis, Wall Street looked to shift the blame. They've claimed that poor financial literacy led people to sign mortgages they didn't understand or that greed led people to buy houses they couldn't afford.

The amount of wealth held by major colleges and large grant-making foundations is astounding. The National Association of College and University Business Officers' annual study found that 107 institutions held endowments of $1 billion or more as of June 30, 2019. Together, these institutions of higher earning held $494 billion in assets, or roughly a tenth of the total net worth of all individual billionaires in the United States combined. The university figure is surely much higher today.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-04-27	The Washington Post (Online)	So you want to tax the rich? Okay, let’s start with Harvard.	txt-opeds/2518867442.xml.txt	Charitable foundations hold even more wealth. One estimate found they held more than $1 trillion in assets in 2017, with the richest five alone holding nearly $100 billion between them. Given that the stock market has risen more than 50 percent since then, their portfolios should be hundreds of billions of dollars richer. That means America's charitable foundations and billionaire universities hold at least $1.5 trillion in assets. That's far more wealth than that of Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and the founders of Google and Oracle combined. Democrats often criticize these billionaires for not paying their fair shares, but they pay a lot more than these wealthy institutions. Rich universities and grant-making foundations pay a mere 1.4 percent in federal taxes on their net investment income, a fraction of the 23.8 percent rich people pay on their capital gains. To put this in perspective, if Gates made $100 million in trading Microsoft stock, he would pay $23.8 million in federal capital gains tax, plus any state income taxes he might owe. If the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation made the same $100 million trading the same stock, it would pay Uncle Sam a mere $1.4 million.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Harvard may cry that paying higher taxes on the gains from its nearly $40 billion endowment would force it to crimp spending on student aid or faculty research, but wealthy individuals can make the same argument: Higher taxes would reduce the amount of money they can invest in tech start-ups or other economically productive ventures. Plus, both the wealthy institution and the rich individual have more than enough money to make do and adjust to the higher tax rates, especially if the public spending their taxes would finance is so essential.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently introduced her Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act, which would levy an annual 3 percent wealth tax on individuals with assets of $1 billion or more. Perhaps not coincidentally, it does not apply to institutions such as the former law professor's old employer, Harvard University. Had Warren applied the same wealth tax on universities, good old Harvard, which had a $39.4 billion endowment as of 2019, would pay nearly $120 million annually under Warren's proposal, more than twice the $49.8 million it paid on its net investment income in 2019. Applying Warren's tax to the combined fortunes of ultra-rich colleges and foundations would easily raise more than $30 billion a year. That's not chump change.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Only 3 percent of Harvard's faculty members, for example, are conservatives compared with almost 78 percent who say they are ""liberal"" or ""very liberal."" Harvard isn't much of an outlier; a recent study found that registered Democrats at 32 elite colleges and universities outnumber registered Republicans by more than 10 to 1. Foundations also tilt heavily to the left, with clearly left-wing foundations possessing more than 10 times the assets of clearly right-wing institutions.

Despite concerns about needed relief for individuals and the states, almost no push has been made by Democrats for a significant source of revenue to help provide such aid: a wealth tax. Significantly, polls found this tax acceptable to most voters. The truly rich are in little danger of financial suffering.

The pact between Sen. Joe Manchin and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer includes $80 billion in new funding for the tax man. Democrats claim this ""investment"" will yield more than $200 billion in revenue. That estimate is highly speculative, but if it's anywhere close to right IRS auditors will soon be coming after tens of millions of Americans. The $80 billion is more than six times the current annual IRS budget of $12.6 billion. The money will be ladled out over nine years and comes with few strings attached.

The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's official tax scorekeeper, says that from 78% to 90% of the money raised from under-reported income would likely come from those making less than $200,000 a year. Only 4% to 9% would come from those making more than $500,000. The IRS knows the super-wealthy employ lawyers and accountants who make litigation time-consuming and risky.

Despite all this new money, Americans shouldn't expect better IRS service. The agency in the 2022 filing season answered a mere 10% of its phone calls. The Taxpayer Advocate Service revealed in June that as of May 31 the IRS was still sitting on 21.3 million unprocessed paper tax returns, with millions of taxpayers ""waiting six months or more to receive their refunds.""

All of this is likely to be made worse by what seems to be the increasing politicization of the tax agency. Lois Lerner notoriously targeted conservative nonprofits for special scrutiny in 2013.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) leaving 12 candidates, only six of whom were able to qualify for Tuesday night's debate under the party's arcane rules. As Mr. Booker and others exit, two latecomers have entered: former New York City mayor Mike Bloomberg and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick. Both are public servants of accomplishment and stature, though of the two, only Mr. Bloomberg has the vast wealth it takes to buy attention via massive advertising. Mr. Patrick will have to hope for the kind of attention money can't buy. And judging from an hour-long conversation with him at The Post on Tuesday, we'd say he deserves at least a hearing. On paper, the 63-year-old has always been a plausible contender: He rose from humble beginnings on the South Side of Chicago to attend college and law school at Harvard;  pursued both public-interest and corporate law before serving the Clinton administration as assistant attorney general for civil rights; and won election as Massachusetts' chief executive twice, in 2006 and 2010.

The idea hasn’t exactly caught fire in Sacramento, however, so several of the bill’s backers offered a new option Thursday: taxing large accumulations of wealth. The state already taxes at least two types of assets, property and vehicles (including boats). The new bill aims at everything else, and by everything, I mean that literally. The bill would apply a 0.4% tax to “all worldwide property,” excluding real estate owned directly, exempting the first $30 million (or $15 million for married taxpayers filing separately).

I mean, none of us writers are that loaded, so why not? And a broad tax on assets, which a few other countries impose, could conceivably be a useful tool in a progressive tax system that seeks to narrow income inequality. But my fellow editorial board members balked at the other last-minute effort to raise taxes on the rich, noting that “there’s simply not enough time to properly vet such a major tax change before the pandemic-shortened legislative session ends on Aug. 31.” (See?

That’s because the tax would also be imposed on former residents who left within the past decade, presumably to catch those who fled the state’s income tax rates, which already are the highest in the country. It also would apply the highest wealth-tax rate to anyone who’d spent a decade or more in California, a bizarre choice that would only increase the incentive for longtime residents to move out.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The bill calls on the Franchise Tax Board to come up with a way to value non-publicly-traded assets, yet the tax would go into effect immediately. Nor is it at all clear how the state would enforce against the many, many ways that wealthy people would find to avoid the tax. The shifting of assets to global tax havens is an enormous problem for governments around the world, but it requires a concerted international effort to solve it. Meanwhile, the simplest way to avoid the new California tax would be to leave the state and then challenge California’s authority to tax nonresidents for assets moved elsewhere.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Here’s just one question they’d need to study: By forcing people to sell assets potentially at a loss in order to pay their tax bills, will the measure cut into the capital gains revenue upon which California is inordinately dependent? The point is, developing good tax policy requires more than just deciding which trees to shake. It’s looking at the whole forest of intertwined limbs, and figuring out how a measure aimed at one stand of trees will affect the others.

He also said he would favor a financial transaction tax. All of that adds up to a highly progressive agenda, I responded.

Obama was constrained by congressional Republicans and by a misunderstanding among many politicians, in both parties, about how progressive the American public really was on economic policy. “What I’m proposing might be considered conservative by the standards of the 50s, 60s or 70s.” Buttigieg said. “And so where I think we are today is the beginning of a totally new chapter.” As I’ve thought back on the hour that we spent talking, I’m most struck by Buttigieg’s combination of ambition and realism. His agenda is highly ambitious, spanning much higher taxes on the rich; both a Green New Deal approach and a carbon tax; statehood for Washington, D.C., and potentially Puerto Rico; abolition of the Electoral College; a less politicized Supreme Court; and more.	2	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Michelle is more sympathetic to it than Ross, not surprisingly, but both raise some smart concerns. The most obvious one is his relative lack of experience. As I suggested during the interview, I think it’s a weakness for his candidacy but not necessarily a fatal one. Buttigieg clearly has much less experience than most presidents did. On the other hand, he’s run a city for seven years and served in the Navy, which  would give him more relevant experience coming into the job than President Trump had and roughly as much as Obama had.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

So, when Warren declares that President Trump is ""part of a corrupt, rigged system that has helped the wealthy and the well-connected and kicked dirt in the faces of everyone else,"" it resonates with almost no one except those on the political left. There is a good reason for that. Unemployment is near a record low, and the United States has about 1.6 million more job openings than unemployed people to fill them. Not only are jobs plentiful, but wages are rising. And the New York Times reported in May that ""over the past year, low-wage workers have experienced the fastest pay increases."" Americans don't just think they are doing better in the Trump economy, they are doing better. Little wonder Democrats barely mentioned the economy in Tuesday's debate.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-10-17	The Washington Post (Online)	Elizabeth Warren the front-runner? That’s great news for Republicans.	txt-opeds/2306390875.xml.txt	This progress is bad news for Warren. Why on earth would Americans rally to her call for ""big structural change"" to the economy when they say the economy is working for them? Especially when they learn the structural changes Warren is proposing would cost tens of trillions of dollars and — whether she admits it or not — would require them to pay more in taxes? Manhattan Institute budget expert Brian Riedl recently added up the price tag for Warren's proposals, and the numbers are staggering: $30 trillion to $40 trillion over 10 years for Medicare-for-all; $2 trillion for Social Security expansion over the same period; $3 trillion for climate change and environmental policies; $2 trillion free college and student loan forgiveness; and another $1 trillion for initiatives that include free child care and housing. ""Total cost: $38 trillion to $48 trillion,"" Riedl says. And that's before calculating the cost of offering free government health care to illegal immigrants, which Warren supports. There's no way to pay for that miasma of spending with Warren's wealth tax; it will require massive middle-class tax increases.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

To win in 2020, Democrats need to win over voters who like Trump's policies but don't like Trump. They can't do that by telling these voters they are wrong about the economy working for them, and that they need to make peace with socialism. Instead, they need to convince voters that they can dump Trump and still keep their prosperity. If Democrats nominate Warren, they will give voters suffering from Trump exhaustion no safe harbor. Her nomination would turn the election into an existential threat to the American economy. And since Warren said Tuesday that, if she is elected, and Democrats take back the Senate, they will ""repeal the filibuster,"" she will be able to pass her radical agenda by simple majority vote. That means Trump's message — ""whether you love me or hate me, you have got to vote for me"" — will ring true for millions of Americans whose votes might otherwise be up for grabs.	3	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays. “I don’t think that billionaires should exist,” Senator Bernie Sanders told The Times on Tuesday after announcing a proposal to tax the wealth of the country’s richest citizens. Mr. Sanders joins fellow senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren in championing the idea as a means of curbing runaway inequality and funding social programs that would benefit the rest of the country. “This proposal does not eliminate billionaires, but it eliminates a lot of the wealth that billionaires have, and I think that’s exactly what we should be doing,” he said.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Here’s How Those Plans Would Work (or Not).” The debate: Do we need a wealth tax? WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW Proposals for closing the gap between the country’s rich and poor often revolve around taxing income, but a staggering amount of wealth is increasingly locked up, like fresh water in glaciers, in fortunes that rich people have already accrued or inherited. The three richest Americans — Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates — now own more wealth than the bottom half of the country. While net worth nearly tripled for the top 1 percent between 1995 and 2016, it barely budged for the middle class, which is still recovering from the Great Recession, and went negative for the bottom 10 percent, according to Brookings and the Urban Institute. The racial wealth gap has also widened, with the median white family owning 10 times more wealth than the median black family.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

This guide will put in context what people are saying about the pressing issues of the week. Sign up for our new newsletter, Debatable.] WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING Capitalism needs a wealth tax The idea of a wealth tax is not new, but it gained mainstream popularity with the publication in 2013 of the French economist Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the book that launched a thousand think pieces. Mr. Piketty, who has expressed support for both Ms. Warren’s and Mr. Sanders’s campaigns, argued that a capitalist economy inevitably produces wealth inequality that is self-perpetuating and, if left unchecked, “potentially terrifying.” He wrote: When the rate of return on capital exceeds the rate of growth of output and income, as it did in the nineteenth century and seems quite likely to do again in the twenty-first, capitalism automatically generates arbitrary and unsustainable inequalities that radically undermine the meritocratic values on which democratic societies are based.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-09-26	New York Times (Online)	Do We Need a Wealth Tax?	txt-opeds/2297469381.xml.txt	To avert what he calls “patrimonial capitalism,” where rich people get ever richer only by virtue of being rich in the first place, Mr. Piketty prescribed a global wealth tax, progressing from 1 percent on assets of one million euros to 5 to 10 percent on assets above a billion euros (as well as an “optimal” top marginal income tax in developed countries around 80 percent). “Short of that, many may turn against globalization,” he wrote with prescience in The Financial Times in 2014. “If, one day, they found a common voice, it would speak the disremembered mantras of nationalism and economic isolation.”	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-09-26	New York Times (Online)	Do We Need a Wealth Tax?	txt-opeds/2297469381.xml.txt	A wealth tax may not work Even those sympathetic to the spirit of a wealth tax acknowledge that there are considerable pragmatic obstacles to its implementation. Even if there were sufficient political will to pass it, it could face a constitutional challenge. Megan McArdle, a libertarian Washington Post columnist, writes: The big problem is Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, which forbids “direct taxes” on people or property unless they’re “apportioned” — doled out among the states by population. Instituting an income tax required a constitutional amendment to override that clause, and Warren’s plan might well require another.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-09-26	New York Times (Online)	Do We Need a Wealth Tax?	txt-opeds/2297469381.xml.txt	Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have cited numerous legal experts who say a wealth tax would be constitutional. But with the Supreme Court’s composition being what it is, the question is far from settled. There’s also the matter of enforcement. As Paul Krugman notes, the wealthy are quite good at avoiding taxes and evading them illegally. And because many assets owned by the ultra-wealthy — like artwork and diamonds — aren’t always traded on the market, Ms. McArdle writes, taxing them would mean “creating a lot of administrative capacity to track and price the assets, with the wealthy and their lawyers fighting every step of the way.”	6	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-09-26	New York Times (Online)	Do We Need a Wealth Tax?	txt-opeds/2297469381.xml.txt	“If these difficulties prove insurmountable,” writes Noah Smith, a left-leaning economist, in Bloomberg, “Warren and other egalitarian tax crusaders might consider an alternative — an inheritance tax, which would close many of the loopholes that now riddle the U.S. estate tax.” He adds: Taxing all income from inheritances — including trusts, foundations, gifts, estates, and any other kind of family transfers — at a very high rate would yield a result similar to a small annual wealth tax, only its constitutionality would be less in doubt. And it would focus the tax on the rich people whose fortunes Americans are most likely to think of as being undeserved.	7	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-09-26	New York Times (Online)	Do We Need a Wealth Tax?	txt-opeds/2297469381.xml.txt	A wealth tax is a bad idea Skeptics of the idea of a wealth tax argue that it has a bumpy track record. While 12 European countries had a wealth tax in 1990, Greg Rosalsky writes in NPR, only three (Norway, Spain and Switzerland) still do. He writes: According to reports by the OECD and others, there were some clear themes with the policy: it was expensive to administer, it was hard on people with lots of assets but little cash, it distorted saving and investment decisions, it pushed the rich and their money out of the taxing countries — and, perhaps worst of all, it didn’t raise much revenue.	8	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-09-26	New York Times (Online)	Do We Need a Wealth Tax?	txt-opeds/2297469381.xml.txt	An economist and leading inequality scholar who has advised Ms. Warren, Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, says that her wealth tax is designed with those failures in mind, since it applies only to the ultra-wealthy, taxes citizens wherever they live and imposes a 40 percent “exit tax” on Americans worth more than $50 million who renounce their citizenship. Still others oppose the idea on principle, for the very reasons many support it. Michael R. Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, writes in Bloomberg: Warren’s wealth tax would be an abuse of government power. It is the tax-code equivalent of looting mansions. What is wrong with the way these 75,000 families made their money? Paying taxes is not a punishment, and the tax code should not be used to penalize any group of citizens. Not even the very rich.	9	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-09-26	New York Times (Online)	Do We Need a Wealth Tax?	txt-opeds/2297469381.xml.txt	A wealth tax is only a start A wealth tax could close the country’s wealth gap from the top, and the universal social programs it helps fund could go some way to closing the wealth gap at the bottom. But more targeted redistributive measures, like reparations, may be needed to completely close the gap between blacks and whites, argues William Darity Jr., a professor of public policy at Duke University. He told The Times: That’s an objective that is not achieved by any of the existing policies on the table now. Ultimately, you need a person-based program if you’re really concerned about the racial wealth gap. And it not only has to be person-based, but it has to be race-specific.	10	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-09-26	New York Times (Online)	Do We Need a Wealth Tax?	txt-opeds/2297469381.xml.txt	Some on the left have also criticized the idea of a wealth tax as utopian in its belief that those at capitalism’s helm would steer the system in a direction it by nature does not want to go. To fix the problem at the root, writes Benjamin Kunkel in The London Review of Books, imagine a market socialist revolution through which the shares of all corporations are transferred into public hands. With ownership of the means of production more evenly distributed, inequality wouldn’t deepen automatically as Mr. Piketty says it does under capitalism. Mr. Kunkel writes: The notion of such a revolution — first in one country, then gatheringly international but not yet universal — is fanciful right now. But is it more so than a global capital tax requiring the coordination of virtually all nations? … Socialist revolution frankly seems more likely. … Capitalism can dispense with democracy more easily than with profits.	11	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Six years later, the ground has shifted — or at least appears to have. “I’m delighted to see people talking about a wealth tax,” Ms. Warren said on Tuesday after Mr. Sanders announced his plan. “We need all of the presidential candidates talking about it. Where are the rest of them?” Two is a coincidence, the saying goes, but three would make a trend.	12	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

2019-02-26	The Washington Post (Online)	Let’s fight for universal child care	txt-opeds/2186021370.xml.txt	A few weeks ago, Nation columnist Katha Pollitt wrote a compelling New York Times piece endorsing ""day care for all."" Noting that child care is ""one of the biggest costs a family faces,"" often surpassing even college tuition, Pollitt argued that a lack of affordable child care is a problem on par with challenges that receive far more attention from leading progressives. ""So why isn't it on the front burner of the revitalized left?"" she asked. The question turned out to be prescient. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) unveiled her proposal for universal child care in the United States. While other candidates have discussed the need for affordable child care — and it was one of Hillary Clinton's priorities in 2016 — Warren's plan is clearly the most ambitious proposal to date. It would establish a network of federally funded, locally run child-care centers across the nation. Enrollment would be completely free for millions of children and affordable for all, with the total cost per family capped at 7 percent of a family's income, no matter the number of kids. The centers would be staffed by qualified care providers, who would be paid similarly to teachers. Access would be guaranteed, but families with the means to choose other options would be free to do so. And it would be fully paid for with revenue from the wealth tax Warren has called for on households with a net worth greater than $50 million.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-02-26	The Washington Post (Online)	Let’s fight for universal child care	txt-opeds/2186021370.xml.txt	Warren's proposal should spark an overdue and necessary conversation about a problem that leaders in both parties have long neglected. More than half of Americans now live in child care ""deserts,"" according to the Center for American Progress, including significant majorities of rural and Latino families. Compared with the rest of the world, the United States spends pathetically little on family benefits, ranking second-to-last among developed nations. ""This dearth of family benefits leads to two cruel outcomes,"" writes Matt Bruenig, whose People's Policy Project recently published its own set of ideas for addressing the child-care crisis. ""It denies many people the ability to have the families that they want and inflicts financial ruin on many of those who go through with parenthood despite the lack of social support.""	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-02-26	The Washington Post (Online)	Let’s fight for universal child care	txt-opeds/2186021370.xml.txt	Women especially suffer the consequences of this neglect, often sacrificing their careers and other opportunities to pick up the slack. Yet while it is fitting that universal child care would gain traction at a time when women are playing an increasingly vital role in the national debate, Warren's proposal would not only improve the lives of women or even parents. Its impact would also ripple outward, benefiting all Americans. In fact, Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi estimates that Warren's plan would generate twice as much growth per year over a decade as Trump's corporate tax cut at less than half the cost — and that's if the $1.5 trillion in tax cuts were paid for, which of course they were not. So, in addition to proposing good family policy, Warren is offering a boost to the economy that deserves to be covered and debated accordingly.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But the United States has experimented with universal child care before with great success. In the 1940s, when millions of women joined the workforce to support the war effort, the government temporarily offered subsidized child care through a law known as the Lanham Act. The program was hugely popular and, studies later showed, effective. Not only did it empower more women to work, but also the children who participated went on to see increased high school and college graduation rates, better employment prospects and higher earnings. Years later, Congress passed bipartisan legislation to establish a national child-care system, but President Richard Nixon vetoed the bill, warning that it would create ""a new army of bureaucrats"" and condemning its ""family-weakening implications.""	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Those are all big warning signs. They show that the United States is suffering through an era of slow growth — and that the gains from that growth are flowing disproportionately to a small slice of mostly affluent households, making the gains for everyone else even smaller than the disappointing G.D.P. statistics would indicate. All of which leaves me perplexed by some of the commentary about the wealth taxes proposed by Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. From a story in The Times: “The idea of redistributing wealth by targeting billionaires is stirring fierce debates at the highest ranks of academia and business, with opponents arguing it would cripple economic growth, sap the motivation of entrepreneurs who aspire to be multimillionaires and set off a search for loopholes.”	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-10-02	New York Times (Online)	A Wealth Tax Is Pro-Growth	txt-opeds/2299757196.xml.txt	[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] There are two problems with the arguments from these opponents. First, they’re based on a premise that the American economy is doing just fine and we shouldn’t mess with success. But as the statistics above make clear, the economy is not doing fine. The country should be looking for new approaches. Second, while it’s plausible that a wealth tax might further depress economic growth, it’s also plausible that a wealth tax would accelerate economic growth. Somehow, the opponents leave out that part. How would it accelerate growth? Right now, the American economy is suffering from extreme inequality. A large portion of society’s resources are held by a tiny slice of people, who aren’t using the resources very efficiently. As my colleague Paul Krugman wrote this week, referring to Warren’s plans, “The only people who would be directly affected by her tax proposals are those who more or less literally have more money than they know what to do with.”	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-10-02	New York Times (Online)	A Wealth Tax Is Pro-Growth	txt-opeds/2299757196.xml.txt	Sure, it’s theoretically possible that some entrepreneurs and investors might work less hard because of a 2 percent annual tax on their holdings above $50 million (the tax threshold under the Warren plan), thus sapping economic growth. But it’s more likely that any such effect would be small — and more than outweighed by the return that the economy would get on the programs that a wealth tax would finance, like education, scientific research, infrastructure and more. Those basic investments all have a long record of lifting economic growth. The very wealthy, however, don’t tend to spend much of their money building roads, starting community colleges or financing clean energy.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

The truth is that there isn't just one, and never is. There are always plenty of critiques one can make of the other side. But if they're looking to put one at the top of the list, there's no single attack that works better than this one: Trump and Republicans are serving the wealthy and powerful at the expense of everyone else.

The public has misconceptions about a lot of things, but this is an area where they understand reality quite well. There has in fact been a huge increase in inequality in recent years.

It doesn't matter if your tax plan is the one that hits the wealthy the hardest; you can still make an argument about inequality and unfairness in the system.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-12-06	The Washington Post (Online)	Democrats should never stop talking about raising taxes on the rich	txt-opeds/2322298214.xml.txt	Again and again in recent history, Democrats have left this incredibly potent set of arguments sitting on the shelf. They put out plans to raise taxes on the wealthy, but they don't place this critique at the center of their campaigns. They don't hammer it day in and day out. They allow someone like Trump to claim to be a populist. And all it takes is someone saying, ""Hey, didn't you get some donations from people who work on Wall Street?"" to make them clam up and change the subject. But this argument is so effective because it resonates with people's lives and what they see around them. It connects specific policy proposals to broader themes about what's wrong with the system and how to change it, and whom Democrats and Republicans represent. And most revealingly, it's the last thing any Republican ever wants to talk about.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

2019-03-01	The Washington Post (Online)	Elizabeth Warren wrote a book of personal finance advice. How does it hold up?	txt-opeds/2187088383.xml.txt	As someone who has covered the personal finance industry for years, I like to say there are three schools of personal finance and investment writing. The first suggests that if we spend our money responsibly, we can slowly and surely grow our security and nest eggs. The second argues that our problem isn't that we are irresponsible; it's that we don't have enough money to spend, a situation that can be remedied not by watching our budgets but by speculatively investing in stocks and/or real estate. The third school is much less common: It suggests that while we are not powerless, the problem is less irresponsible spending and/or failure to invest aggressively, and more outside of ourselves, from our society. We need to arm ourselves with personal finance guidance so we can best protect ourselves in a predatory economy.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-03-01	The Washington Post (Online)	Elizabeth Warren wrote a book of personal finance advice.

Will our next president come from the third? Friday marks the fourteenth anniversary of the publication of ""All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan,"" a personal finance advice book co-written by now-Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) with her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi. Its roots lie in the duo's previous book, ""The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Parents Are (Still) Going Broke,"" which outlined a then-controversial but now-commonplace critique of American society: Increasing numbers of people are finding themselves in financial hot water not because they are living large but because the cost of housing, health care, education, and child care is increasing faster than their salaries. ""The Two-Income Trap"" concluded not just with policy recommendations but also with suggestions for protecting oneself from these forces. While politicians noted the political critique — raising Warren's profile in Washington — in popular culture Warren began to get notice for those financial tips. Daytime television personality Phil McGraw, a.k.a. Dr. Phil, repeatedly invited Warren on his popular show to counsel financially troubled families a la Suze Orman. A newly minted personal finance star needs a book. ""All Your Worth"" was the result.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

While acknowledging that ""you can't count on good old-fashioned hard work the way your parents did,"" it also tells them ""you have to learn the new rules"" of money. ""This book could show you how to cover your bills, without worry or fear,"" the authors write, as long as ""you are ready to take charge of your money."" As for the vaunted balance?

Even then this was Pollyanna-ish advice. Child care is also about reliability, and Warren recently discussed how her own child-care woes were solved only when a family member offered to take them on. In a majority of states, child care is now more expensive than sending that child to a public college.

That said, the book's discussion of student loans is so perfunctory, Warren tells me, that if she were to issue a new edition of the book, she would devote much more attention to the issue. She should. In 2005, there was $363 billion in outstanding student loan debt. That increased to a staggering $1.5 trillion in 2018.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

""Warren has a level of understanding and empathy with average people's struggles that's missing from too many personal finance books. She acknowledges how profoundly the deck can be stacked against people, but armors them with the tools they need to get ahead anyway,"" NerdWallet personal finance columnist Liz Weston told me. Warren puts herself firmly on the side of the person ""who works hard and plays by the rules"" but still wants to enjoy the occasional luxury. Chapter 4 is titled ""If You Can't Afford Fun, You Can't Afford Your Life."" She's a cheerleader, urging people on, but not delusional. An expert on bankruptcy, she calls filing for it an exercise in ""hope for the future"" because ""bankruptcy is designed to give you a fresh start.""

Among those who embraced ""All Your Worth"" was born-again, right-wing personal finance pundit Dave Ramsey, who invited Warren on his hugely popular radio show, and, as I put it in my book ""Pound Foolish,"" could ""sound like a breathless teenager in love"" when he discussed Warren's war on the abusive practices of the predatory credit industry.	7	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Two years after the book's publication, she outlined what would become the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in an article for the journal Democracy. Her last appearance on ""Dr. Phil"" was in 2008. The problem was ultimately less personal than political. ""These books show why you need the systemic changes I'm proposing as a candidate for president. Universal child care and early learning. Housing reform. Wealth tax.

In fact, it's damning — of American society, of the age of inequality — that so many people can try to follow its advice and still find themselves in financial trouble.

You don't have to imagine. That pretty well describes the fifth Democratic presidential debate on Wednesday night. It covered a much broader range of concerns than the earlier encounters, including an extensive set of queries on foreign policy.

Biden had a painfully slow response to an opening question and an embarrassing gaffe when he referred to ""the only African American woman who'd ever been elected to the United States Senate"" with Harris onstage nearby. But he also had some his strongest moments of the encounters so far. He was particularly quick and clear when asked by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow whether he would seek an indictment of President Trump.

Warren was dominant in the early going with a brisk defense of her wealth tax, which she repeatedly described as asking those earning more than $50 million just ""two cents"" on the dollar.

As expected, Buttigieg, who is surging in the polls in both Iowa and New Hampshire, was tested by several of those running behind. Klobuchar, who had said that a woman with Buttigieg's qualifications would not be taken seriously as a candidate, said she considered Buttigieg qualified but that ""women are held to a higher standard.""

The question that dominated on Wednesday was: Do these contenders really disagree all that much? Of course, they do disagree, as Warren and Sanders especially wanted to make clear by way of contrast with their more moderate adversaries. But it was a salutary break from an all-Trump, all-the-time Washington to hear discourses on how to build houses, how to make college affordable and how to help families care for their kids.

This week, Saez and Zucman published a rejoinder. Their response is disingenuous.

In reality, we are explicit that $25 billion is a rough back-of-the-envelope number and state that ""We would be surprised if the $25-billion-a-year figure we suggest was not a significant underestimate of the revenue potential of a 2 percent wealth tax.""

But they should keep in mind that Saez and Zucman are writing in a commissioned letter to a presidential candidate for a campaign proposal. Meanwhile, experts with experience in tax policy scorekeeping and academics on the progressive end of the political spectrum — such as ourselves and MIT economist Jonathan Gruber — are much more pessimistic on the revenue-raising potential of wealth taxation. In this context, Saez and Zucman's indignant insistence that their $187 billion number is not a ""best case scenario"" but instead a ""middle-ground"" estimate seems unsound.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

This point is well illustrated by the difference between academic and government estimates of taxing carried interest as ordinary income or of the value-added tax. Nothing in Saez and Zucman's response suggests they are immune from this problem. They attempt a broad allowance for tax avoidance, assuming the rich would successfully shelter at most 15 percent of their wealth from taxation. They base this guess on four academic studies that consider the international experience of wealth taxation, which find that a 1 percent wealth tax reduces reported wealth by 0.5 and 35 percent, which they simply average to 15 percent. But this strikes us as too low.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-06-28	The Washington Post (Online)	Be very skeptical about how much revenue Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax could generate	txt-opeds/2248856154.xml.txt	First, Saez and Zucman's interpretation of the international experience differs from ours. They rely on estimates suggesting that a 1 percent wealth tax in Denmark and Sweden results in evasion of less than 1 percent (which makes their 15 percent estimate look huge). But in both countries, wealth taxation proved so easy to avoid and so difficult to administer that these taxes were repealed. In fact, of the 12 nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that had wealth taxes in 1990, only three still have them today. Second, the estate tax is informative on the potential magnitude of wealth tax evasion. Let's consider Saez and Zucman's estimated tax base for people with wealth greater than $50 million: about $9.3 trillion in 2019. If we were to apply the current 40 percent estate tax to this figure — assuming 2 percent of those families will experience a death this year (a conservative estimate) — we would expect that tax to generate about $75 billion this year. And if we apply the effective estate tax to that figure (accounting for charitable contributions and spousal bequests), it would raise $25 billion this year. In reality, the estate tax will raise about $10 billion from estates of more than $50 million this year. In other words, it seems plausible that tax avoidance is closer to 60 percent.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-06-28	The Washington Post (Online)	Be very skeptical about how much revenue Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax could generate	txt-opeds/2248856154.xml.txt	It is worth noting that estimating the tax base for those worth more than $50 million in itself is a difficult task — let alone estimating the revenue that taxing these households can raise. Different approaches to measuring top wealth can paint very different pictures. And the numbers reported in the Forbes 400, which Saez and Zucman rely on repeatedly in their rejoinder, are thought of by many as dubious. This isn't to say that our method should be viewed as definitive, but it does suggest the Saez and Zucman estimation is likely too high. As an illustration of the crudity of their analysis: They neglect to contend with behavioral responses that would inevitably follow a 2 percent tax on a small group of wealth holders. For example, there would be a significant incentive to accelerate charitable giving, which would decrease the wealth tax base. It seems important to account for the fact that the wealthy (and their tax planners) will inevitably be motivated to limit tax liability.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

We share their view that more could be done to collect estate tax revenue (and tax revenue more generally).

Her idea was ambitious and controversial, but Sanders's idea goes much, much farther. Warren's plan is relatively straightforward: Tax all assets above $50 million at 2 percent per year and all assets above $1 billion at 3 percent per year. Sanders's plan not only kicks in earlier, it includes more gradations that tax the mega-rich much more heavily.

""Under this plan, the wealth of billionaires would be cut in half over 15 years,"" the plan says, ""which would substantially break up the concentration of wealth and power of this small privileged class."" While the right might despise wealth taxes for ideological reasons, some liberals dislike them for practical reasons. In Europe, a dozen countries had wealth taxes a few decades ago, but now that number has been reduced to three: Norway, Spain and Switzerland. Countries decided that the rich found it too easy to avoid the tax, in many cases just moving out of the country, and they wound up raising less revenue than the governments had hoped.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

""If Warren and Sanders really want to crack down on inequality, they should address the market structures that generate inequality, such as patent and copyright monopolies, a bloated financial industry and a corrupt corporate governance structure,"" Baker said.

Jared Bernstein of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities offered me this qualified endorsement: Both Sanders and Warren answer the criticism about the super-rich avoiding the tax by saying they'll make sure the tax is free of loopholes and beef up the IRS budget for enforcement. In fact, revitalizing the IRS should be a priority for any Democrat, whether they pass a wealth tax or not, since Republicans have spent decades eviscerating the agency, with the result that it's incapable of forcing the ultrawealthy to pay what they owe right now. On the politics: Getting either plan through Congress would be a long shot at best, but if nothing else, this discussion can expand the debate around taxes. Sanders would probably argue that fundamental change starts with getting people to consider ideas that some find radical.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Republicans will inevitably argue that billionaires should not have to be burdened by contributing to the country that enabled them to accumulate their vast holdings in the first place, a stance that won't do them any favors with the voting public. As enthusiastically as some Fox personalities will make that case (they're already doing it), I say it's the last thing President Trump would like to talk about. That's especially true if Sanders or Warren becomes the nominee, since they'd run campaigns centered on the idea that wealthy people have rigged the system in their favor.

In some fundamental ways, the American economy isn’t working for the majority of Americans. The best thing about Elizabeth Warren’s presidential campaign is that she is trying to offer solutions that match the scale of the problem. [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] In response, of course, her critics have declared her ideas too bold. “Warren has already drawn criticism from centrists and conservatives who say her plans — many calling for new regulations — would hurt business and the economy, stifle innovation and potentially harm the very workers they were intended to help,” as The Times reported yesterday.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

A truly healthy economy doesn’t produce falling life expectancy, stagnant wealth and slow-growing incomes for most people. I like much of Warren’s agenda (though not all of it).

2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	Leon Cooperman, one of America's outstanding billionaire crybabies, has launched a public fight with Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren over her proposal for a wealth tax, thus gifting those who follow the normally dull and dreary debate over fiscal policy with a momentary voyeuristic thrill. Important issues lie at the core of this fight, so it's wrong to dismiss it as merely a spat. So we'll delve beneath the surface. One key question is whether Cooperman, for all his hand-wringing, has a point in critiquing Warren's proposal. Short answer: He does, but mostly he doesn't. But first, here's the outline of the fight. Warren in January proposed a tax of 2% on net worth above $50 million and another 1% on net worth above $1 billion. When he was asked last month by Politico to comment on Warren's policies, Cooperman dellivered a profane outburst, stating, ""This is the [blankety-blank] American dream she's [blankety-blanking] on."" Those seeking the quote in its full technicolor glory can find it here.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	Warren tweeted back, ""Leon, you were able to succeed because of the opportunities this country gave you. Now why don't you pitch in a bit more so everyone else has a chance at the American dream too?"" Cooperman responded with a five-page missive, duly circulated to the press, under the letterhead of his Omega Family Office investment headquarters. Cooperman's letter provides lots of material to chew on. Written in a more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger passive aggressive tone, it opens with the gripe that Warren in her tweet had admonished him like ""a parent chiding an ungrateful child,"" which understandably would get under the skin of a 76-year-old former Goldman Sachs investment banker.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	Cooperman proceeds to describe his life as ""a classic American success story,"" beginning with his upbringing as the son of an emigrant Polish plumber, proceeding to his education in public school and college, and on to his career at Goldman Sachs, his great wealth (he doesn't say so, but Forbes ranks him 268th among its 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $3.2 billion), and his devotion to philanthropic causes. Reading this portion, I was struck with a strong sense of having read all this before. It turns out that my deja vu was warranted, because Cooperman had written it all in a letter he sent to President Barack Obama in 2011, chiding Obama for ""your and your minions' role in setting the tenor of the rancorous debate now roiling us that smacks of what so many have characterized as 'class warfare.'""	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	Cooperman asked, ""Is the tone of the current debate really constructive?"" This resembles Cooperman's objection, in the new letter, to Warren's ""vilification of the rich."" (As we've observed before, such appeals from the mountaintop for ""civility"" or ""constructive criticism"" often mask a domineering intent.) The letter to Warren then proceeds to the gist of their economic disagreement. Let's take his points in turn. Cooperman first offers a roster of self-made billionaires who have accumulated their wealth ""by providing a product or service that others want or are willing to pay for."" They include Bill Gates, Home Depot founder Arthur Blank and Bernie Marcus, and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. He's right that, to varying degrees, they've made contributions to society. But by listing them according to the employment they've provided, he seems to be suggesting that giving people jobs is an expression of altruism, as opposed to a necessity for creating a successful business.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	He then takes aim at Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, the UC Berkeley economists on whose research into wealth inequality Warren's tax proposal is based. Cooperman repeats a common criticism that their finding that the U.S. tax system is inherently flat or regressive that the rich pay as much or less in taxes than the middle-class or poor as a percentage of their income ignores ""transfer payments"" that are generally paid to the middle-class or poor. By Cooperman's reckoning, these include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. But he's wrong about Social Security, and to a lesser extent Medicare. Social Security isn't a transfer payment. It's funded by the recipients' own contributions over their lifetimes those born after 1965 have contributed, on average, enough to fully fund their own benefits. Payroll contributions also fund Medicare, which also charges premiums.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	Cooperman acknowledges that state and local sales taxes are indeed regressive, falling more heavily at the lower end of the income scale. But he waves away that point, asserting that they ""have nothing to do with federal fiscal policy and tax code structure."" But that's nonsense. States and localities have had to raise sales taxes in part because federal budget-cutting has pushed expenses down to them. The federal tax cuts enacted by Republicans in December 2017, moreover, put pressure on state and local tax structures by limiting their deductibility on federal taxes a case in which federal tax code structure has a direct impact on state and local taxes, especially in states such as California and New York (where Cooperman pays at least some of his local taxes).	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	Cooperman further asserts that Saez and Zucman ignore taxes on the ""future dividends, interest and capital gains earned on savings,"" which leads them to ""understate taxes on the rich."" This is pure sleight of hand. As Ed Kleinbard, the ace tax professor at USC, has pointed out, the tax on capital gains is America's only voluntary tax it isn't paid until the underlying assets are sold, and if they're held until the owner's death, the tax is extinguished for his or her heirs. Cooperman even acknowledges this feature further down in his letter, and even advocates its repeal. Dividends, though they're taxed the year of issuance, receive a lower tax rate than wages.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	The letter then disputes the notion that the wealthy aren't paying their fair share of taxes. We hear these statistics all the time: The top 1% of taxpayers pay a greater share of federal income taxes, (37.3%) than the bottom 90% combined (30.5%), the top 50% of taxpayers accounted for 97% of all individual income taxes, etc., etc. He's right that the wealthy pay the most income tax. But what Cooperman doesn't mention is the extreme imbalances in income and wealth that account for much of the imbalance in tax liability. The top 1% earned more than 20% of all national income in 2018; the bottom half only about 12%. As Isabel V. Sawhill and Christopher Pulliam of the Brookings Institution have reported, America's top 20% held 77% of total household wealth in 2016, more than three times the holdings of the middle class, defined as households in the 20%-80% economic segments	7	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	Another factor Cooperman ignores and perhaps the most important factor is that tax rates on the rich have come sharply down over time. According to calculations by Saez and Zucman, the average tax rate on the top 0.01% of income earners (those with income of more than about $8 million today) was more than 67% in 1950. Today it's about 33%. The average rate on the top 400 was 70% in 1950 and about 23% today. Cooperman glides over this fact indeed, in his letter to Warren he doesn't mention even once the 2017 tax cut, which was aimed chiefly at wealthy taxpayers like himself. Given that Warren's wealth tax is manifestly designed to shift the burden back, this is an odd, and telling, omission.	8	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	Professing himself to be at heart a supporter of progressive taxation, Cooperman says the key flaw of the wealth tax is that it's unworkable, ""plagued by issues of constitutionality, tax avoidance, asset valuation, and administrablilty."" One should be wary of arguments against a reform based on its impossibility, even before the legislative process begins. Lots of reforms once thought to be impossible turned out to be anything but think of gay marriage and healthcare reform, just for starters. Cooperman points out that many European countries that tried wealth taxes ended up abandoning them, which is true, but he doesn't mention that they typically were abandoned by conservative political regimes, which won't be a label easily attached to a Warren presidency.	9	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-11-01	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Billionaire objects, profanely, to Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax billionaires	txt-opeds/2413924198.xml.txt	The beating heart of Cooperman's argument is that, though the rich should pay more than middle- or low-earners, they're already there. ""At some point,"" he writes, ""higher effective ... rates become confiscatory."" That may be so, but there's no evidence we're anywhere near that now. Quite the contrary, given how far average and marginal tax rates on the wealthy have fallen over the last 50 or 60 years. ""I don't mind working six months of the year for the government and six months for myself,"" he writes, ""paying an effective combined tax rate of 50% on my income."" Who's this ""government"" of which our Lord Bountiful speaks? It's you and me, and our children, and everyone who depends on government services for their health, support, safety and livelihoods. Portraying ""government"" as some faceless other is nothing but a cynical dodge aimed at concealing that it's an entity that represents all the people and has been increasingly indulgent toward those of Cooperman's income sector during his entire career.	10	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

I've cited it often, but it never gets old: ""Whatever is the existing degree of progression,"" Stein wrote, ""people who pay the top rate will think it is too much."" Cooperman makes much of his charitable giving, stating that he intends to donate substantially all of his fortune to charity upon his death. But that evades the question of why the disposition of his wealth should be his subject to his desires or whims. Who's to say that they would correspond to the real needs of society?	11	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Worse, any new round of handouts from the bidenistas would inevitably be tied to Democratic climate claptrap. Nowhere does this approach have worse odds of success than in Argentina, where President Alberto Fernández is running the country into the ground in traditional Argentine fashion. No amount of foreign aid can fix a country where the productive economy has been reduced to a tool to serve the interests of an all-powerful political class. Argentines were frustrated with the failure of center-right President Mauricio Macri to deliver on promises of growth-oriented reform from 2015-19. So they returned the populist left-wing peronists to power in December 2019.

Last week Argentine risk was priced at more than 13.7%. Normally a restructuring takes some heat off public finances and renews government access to capital markets.

He said no one had more reason to be angry with Republicans for attacking him and his son, but if we cannot reach some understandings then ""We are dead,"" he argued. Rather than accuse the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of racism, as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) did, he boasted of his connection to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and cheered for a two-state solution. On China, Biden spoke of re-balancing power to Asia and rebuilding alliances. He got off a witty mark, saying he didn't think President Obama's remark that old men needed to get out of the way referred to him. He turned the question to his advantage, saying with age comes wisdom. He also got a big round of applause when he said he would commit not to run for a second term since he hadn't won anything yet.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

When necessary, he showed some fire, slapping down Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.)'s suggestion he was in the pocket of big donors. He deftly answered questions about our losing strategy in Afghanistan, he made the point (accurately) that he had opposed a big footprint strategy. Ironically, the one issue on which he most vigorously opposed President Obama may be a powerful argument in his favor. He also shredded Medicare-for-all with a flurry of details pointing out it is not feasible or affordable. He turned a final question into a paean to the people he comforts on the trail and calls to check in on, a reminder of his strongest quality, empathy.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

He railed against the new trade deal, insisting we had to end(!) job losses, as if the government has a spigot that can turn off the outflow of jobs.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been dreadful. She repeated many of her campaign themes, such as her wealth tax and anti-corruption measures. It was not anything new, so if you've seen a few of these debates, you might be wondering what else she has to say. She seemed to disappear for stretches of the debate, though she did get off a great line after a moderator noted that she would be the oldest person elected president. ""I'd also be the youngest woman,"" she cracked to laughter and applause. She went after South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg for ""fundraisers in wine caves"" and chided him for not holding open fundraisers, but seemed to lose the round when Biden, Klobuchar and Buttigieg slapped down her suggestion they could be bought.	4	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

He got through an hour before the heavy fire started. He made a plea to talk about the poor and not just the middle class and used his roots in the Midwest to explain the impact of climate change. He was, as we have come to expect, cool and confident in his delivery. On foreign policy, Buttigieg rightly accused President Trump of interfering in Israel's domestic politics and presiding over chaotic foreign policy. Rather than criticize Israel, he went after Trump for embarrassing himself on the world stage. On China, he made a plea for human rights, accusing Trump of ""trashing"" our values. He asked what message it sends when China ""hears not a peep from the U.S. president?"" He gave a full-throated, passionate defense of immigration, drawing on his experience as mayor interacting with children and families living illegally in the United States without harming anyone.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

When repeatedly tested by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), he forcefully retorted to her attack on his experience reminding her he has risked his life to uphold the Constitution. Remaining poised, he showed he could take a punch without losing his cool. Klobuchar, who needs a strong showing in Iowa, would arguably be most harmed by an impeachment trial in the Senate that demands her attendance in the weeks leading up to the caucus. This may have been her best chance to reach early state voters before the voting starts on Feb. 3. She started off strong, laying into the president for blocking witnesses and calling the Ukraine scandal a ""global Watergate.""

Unlike some rivals, she does not recycle the same set pieces. Klobuchar chided Sanders for his Medicare-for-all plan that is not even acceptable to moderate Democrats.

She took a slap at Buttigieg, emphasizing his title as mayor (read: not big enough for the job) for only using ""talking points"" in defense of the press while she was the daughter of a newspaper man. That one didn't make a lot of sense, but she sounded feisty. She played the adult, stopping the food fight between Warren and Buttigieg on fundraisers to call for talking about what unties us.

As the Democratic presidential campaign began, I was deeply skeptical of Elizabeth Warren. My first objection was that she appeared to have parlayed possible Native American heritage to gain academic jobs (Harvard Law School listed her as Native American beginning in 1995). That offended me, and I knew it would repel huge numbers of voters. Second, I thought she shot from the hip and, with her slight political experience, would wilt on the campaign trail.

Warren has become the gold standard for a policy-driven candidate, and whether or not she wins the Democratic nomination, she’s performing a public service by helping frame the debate. Let’s examine my misperceptions. First, The Boston Globe conducted a rigorous examination of Warren’s legal career, and it is now clear that she never benefited professionally from Native American associations. “The Globe found clear evidence, in documents and interviews, that her claim to Native American ethnicity was never considered by the Harvard Law faculty, which voted resoundingly to hire her, or by those who hired her to four prior positions at other law schools,” the newspaper concluded.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-06-26	New York Times (Online)	Why I Was Wrong About Elizabeth Warren	txt-opeds/2247091354.xml.txt	Then there’s the concern about political naïveté and inexperience. Warren first ran for office only in 2012; even Pete Buttigieg has been in elective politics longer. It’s reasonable to worry about her electability, partly because last year she won re-election in Massachusetts as senator with a smaller share of the popular vote than Hillary Clinton had received two years earlier in the state. In contrast, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota hugely outperformed Clinton. I worried about a tendency to shoot from the hip when Warren misread an article and in 2016 wrote a Facebook rant denouncing a supposedly greedy Trump-supporting investor, Whitney Tilson. In fact: Tilson opposed Trump and agrees with Warren on most issues; indeed, Tilson had previously donated to Warren.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But Warren later apologized, and she has been more careful since. Tilson told me that he thinks the rant was not part of a pattern but perhaps reflected a sleep-deprived moment. More broadly, Warren has improved tremendously as a politician. Early on, she sometimes came across as a stern Harvard professor eager to grill you about an obscure tort case.

She has been a geyser of smart proposals, including one I particularly like for universal child care. This would resemble the outstanding child care program operated by the U.S. military and would benefit both working moms and at-risk kids. Warren also has a range of other proposals, pertaining to everything from election reform to housing, antitrust to corporate governance. Then she offers a wealth tax to help pay for social programs. One of America’s biggest problems is the collapse of the working class and the lower middle class, with suicide at a 30-year high and drug and alcohol abuse causing life expectancy to fall. Warren confronts that crisis head-on both with her personal story and with sharp policies to boost opportunity.

She is a believer in a market economy, regulated to keep it from being rigged, and in corporations that contribute to the well-being of all. And while she’s no expert on foreign policy, her instincts on avoiding war with Iran and showing concern for Palestinians seem good ones. At her best, Warren is also brilliant at shaping the narrative. In 2011, she explained why taxing the rich isn’t “class warfare.” “There’s nobody in this country who got rich on his own — nobody,” she said in a clip that went viral. “You built a factory out there? Good for you! But I want to be clear: You moved your goods to market on the roads the rest of us paid for. You hired workers the rest of us paid to educate.

God bless! Keep a big hunk of it.

So far, Mr. Biden does not appear to be that candidate: On Super Tuesday, he drew just 17 percent of voters under 45, according to exit polls. This week’s primaries revealed a similarly stark generational schism, with younger voters overwhelmingly flocking to Mr. Sanders.

Revising his conservative stance on marijuana is an obvious concession he should make, Mr. Levitz says, since legalization is popular both generally and among key Electoral College constituencies.

Jay Inslee in charge of climate policy or the Environmental Protection Agency, for example). “The emphasis ought to be not just on competence — reminding voters that the grown-ups will be in charge after four years of Trump — but also to show young people that even if Biden isn’t a card-carrying leftist, his presidency would still be the most progressive one in modern U.S. history,” Mr. Bunch writes.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

2020-04-12	New York Times (Online)	Hey Kids: Get Out There and Vote!	txt-opeds/2388645690.xml.txt	Disappointed young progressives and Bernie Sanders supporters should consider the alternative. With Joe Biden the last man standing in the Democratic primary race for president, there is increasingly anxious discussion within the party about how — or even if — the former vice president can win over disappointed progressives. Of particular concern are the younger voters whose energy and idealism fueled the campaign of Bernie Sanders. On April 8, just hours after Mr. Sanders suspended his campaign, a collection of eight progressive groups “building political power for young people” sent Mr. Biden a four-page letter detailing how he could win their support. Their to-do list called on him to embrace a range of progressive policies — including Medicare For All, the “frameworks of the Green New Deal” and a wealth tax — as well as to add progressive advisers to his campaign and, later, his administration. “With young people poised to play a critical role deciding the next president, you need to have more young people enthusiastically supporting and campaigning with you to defeat Trump,” they wrote.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

This is a daunting challenge. Mr. Biden is a 77-year-old moderate who has spent his entire adult life in politics and in many ways embodies The Establishment. So far, he has been running on a backward-looking platform of restoration — not exactly a message to electrify the youth vote. Yet regardless of how hard Mr. Biden might try to overhaul his image, the unfortunate electoral reality — dramatically spotlighted by the Sanders campaign — is that betting on the youth vote remains a losing proposition. An enduring truth of politics is that, whether in presidential years or midterm races, younger voters consistently turn out at a lower rate than older ones. (The 18-29 year olds trail the 30-44-year-olds, who trail the 45-59- year-olds. Voters 60 and up are the Election Day rock stars.) Until that changes, young people will have a tough time getting their concerns taken as seriously as they deserve.	1	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

He inspired them. He championed their issues. He explicitly cast them as the key to his success. While Mr. Biden held sway with voters age 45 and older, Mr. Sanders dominated with the under-45 crowd. And how did this work out for Mr. Sanders? Not well. In state after state, young voters’ enthusiasm for Mr. Sanders failed to translate into cold, hard votes. It’s not that the Democratic primary electorate was, on the whole, unmotivated. Before the coronavirus pandemic upended the country, overall turnout was exceeding turnout in 2016. But among younger voters, turnout was flat or down in many states. In the 14 states that voted on Super Tuesday, participation by those younger than 30 did not top 20 percent, according to exit polls — which also showed these voters making up a smaller share of the electorate than in 2016.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The system feels rigged against them. Even politicians who profess to care about their problems rarely make things better. The current administration may most kindly be described as revanchist. Mr. Sanders struck many young people as their last, best hope — and made clear that he saw them as his. Fair or not, their inability to deliver on his behalf will not go unnoticed in political circles, and going forward, candidates will be that much more hesitant to pin their chances on this demographic. This is a terrible dynamic for young voters and for the nation. Moving America forward requires focusing on the future, which is hard for politicians to do when the electoral influence rests so heavily in the hands of older voters. But politicians go where the votes are, and older voters are reliable — even when they aren’t especially excited about a candidate.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Older people.” And on she went about how the nation is facing perilous times, how President Trump is not up to the challenge and how this is no time to be messing around by not voting. Cardi B may not be best known for her political punditry, but she is not wrong here. Sitting this election out for whatever reason would not serve young voters’ interests in the short or long term.

Elizabeth Warren's solution is a $700 billion federal program. On Tuesday, Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and presidential candidate, unveiled her Universal Child Care and Early Learning plan to turn high-quality child care into a federal entitlement. The federal government, working with states, localities and nonprofits, would subsidize a network of licensed child-care facilities that meet new federal standards for curricula and care. Families earning up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level would pay nothing for child care. Wealthier families would pay no more than 7 percent of their of annual incomes.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren’s plan might make it harder.	txt-opeds/2184333995.xml.txt	For many American families, however, the biggest challenge is not funding care but finding it. Warren's proposal wouldn't fix that problem. Instead, it might create a situation in which parents who already have child care they like wouldn't be able to keep it. Warren's plan would dramatically increase demand for an already-limited number of day-care slots, as out-of-home care suddenly becomes ""free"" or much less expensive for millions of families. The plan would also be available to parents who stay at home with their children, encouraging families to use day-care services they don't necessarily need. The result could be 12 million children, almost double the number currently enrolled, heading off to day care.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-02-21	The Washington Post (Online)	Good day care is hard to find. Elizabeth Warren’s plan might make it harder.	txt-opeds/2184333995.xml.txt	That's if their parents can find a place for them. Warren's plan does not address — and could exacerbate — one of the main reasons child care is so expensive and difficult to come by in the first place: the heavy regulatory burden imposed by states. Day-care licensing is generally managed at state and local levels, and the requirements can be notoriously onerous. Massachusetts is pursuing new background-check requirements so strict they could affect 30 percent of day-care workers in urban areas. A recently implemented District of Columbia rule requires day-care workers to have college degrees. Some regulation of the field makes sense — parents need to have confidence that their children will be safe — but initiatives such as the one in D.C. seem like regulation for regulation's sake.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Karin Housley (R) blames on regulators who have made it difficult to comply with rules that govern things such as water temperature for hand-washing. In California, the number of licensed providers caring for children in private homes has declined by 30 percent over the last 10 years. The regulations affect not just supply, but also cost: A recent Mercatus Center study concluded that simply easing child-staff ratio regulations to allow one more infant per teacher would, on a nationwide basis, reduce average annual costs for a child's care by as much as $1,890 — without reducing the quality of care.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren’s plan might make it harder.	txt-opeds/2184333995.xml.txt	Warren's plan would likely aggravate these challenges. States licensing staffs already struggle to keep up with existing providers and regulations, and Warren's plan would increase both red tape and the number of centers requiring oversight — leading to delayed licensing approvals and causing inspection backlogs. Warren's plan would also create a vicious cycle that increases cost pressures on the families who can afford day care and puts ballooning financial burdens on the federal government. The federal government picks up most of the cost of the ""free"" and subsidized care. But the rest will come from fees that day-care providers charge to families who don't qualify for the subsidy, which will inevitably rise. Parents who earn too much for the subsidy will see their out-of-pocket costs grow — until those costs represent more than 7 percent of their income, at which point they, too, will be drawn into the subsidy pool.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But it ignores this sleeper tax on families worth much, much less. These pressures would be intensified by the Warren plan's requirement that day-care providers who want to participate in the federal subsidy program pay higher wages. Those providers will get federal support to meet the new pay requirements. But day-care providers who don't participate will suddenly have to pay workers more to compete for talent — and they won't be able to pass the bill on to the government. Many providers, particularly in-home or small-scale day-care facilities, may have to shut down. Ironically, many of those who could lose their small businesses are women.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-02-21	The Washington Post (Online)	Good day care is hard to find. Elizabeth Warren’s plan might make it harder.	txt-opeds/2184333995.xml.txt	These challenges ultimately point to a jarring mismatch between supply and demand for care. When the Warren campaign compares the structure and administration of the new universal child-care benefit to Head Start, it neglects to mention that, even though Head Start receives more than $9 billion in federal funding yearly, there are still significant shortages, epic waiting lists, and high unmet need. There isno question that day care is painfully expensive, and parents desperately want to know that, while they're at work, their children are well cared-for. But the United States' child-care challenges are not wholly — or even mostly — creations of the federal government. The introduction of an aggressive federal entitlement isn't the way to solve them.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The top federal income-tax rate rose to 77% in 1918 from 7% in 1913. Following World War I, the top rate came down, reaching just 25% from 1925-31. Rates were raised during the Great Depression to 64% in 1932 and 79% in 1936. In April 1942, Roosevelt proposed a top individual tax rate of 100%, declaring that amid ""grave national danger, when all excess income should go to win the war, no American citizen ought to have a net income, after he has paid his taxes, of more than $25,000"" (the equivalent of a bit more than $400,000 in 2021 dollars). The Treasury Department said this top rate would only affect 11,000 taxpayers. Democrats in Congress pronounced it dead on arrival. Still, the top World War II rate reached 94%.

These reductions were accompanied by removing or altering deductions that had previously helped taxpayers avoid paying the top rate. Today's Democrats aspire to raise rates to the skies while also limiting such offsetting exclusions.

This feeds the belief that tax evasion by wealthy people is pervasive, but ProPublica deceptively treated unrealized asset appreciation as if it were income in an effort to drum up support for a wealth tax.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

But on the campaign trail, Mr. Biden proposed raising the top estate-tax rate to 45% from 40% while lowering the current $11.7 million per person exemption by some unstated amount, along with major exemption reductions to gift taxes. Proposals to tax ""step-up basis"" could result in a 68.9% combined capital gains rate plus estate tax on many successful investors, entrepreneurs and small-business owners. Estates of New York City residents would be subject to an additional 14.776% income and 16% estate tax, for a total tax of 80.7%.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Tax is generally due in cash nine months after death, with installment provisions for large holdings in businesses and farms. IRS statistics from 2018 show that the top 1% of taxpayers (more than $540,000 in income) paid 40.1% of all individual income taxes; the top 5% (about $218,000 in income) paid 60.3%.

People will spend money, eat food, watch (and play) sports, use phone apps and play video games, and countries around the world will engage in diplomacy — and conflict. The details of all those things, as always, will be what make the year interesting. To get a jump on the future, we asked Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big stories, themes and questions that we'll look back on this time next December.

2019-12-26	The Washington Post (Online)	2020: The year in preview	txt-opeds/2330716596.xml.txt	The last few months of 2019 were filled with streaming news. Buckets of it. From the nonstop marketing of Jennifer Aniston in Apple TV Plus's ""The Morning Show"" to that ubiquitous Baby Yoda from Disney Plus's ""The Mandalorian,"" it seemed like the spigot might never turn off. And it won't, not anytime soon. This will be a year of new digital programming — and new services to deliver it. Just two weeks into 2020, Comcast will unveil more details about Peacock, its new service with content from across NBC Universal properties, set to launch several months later. The spring will also bring HBO Max, the prestige-branded service with all manner of TV shows and movies from the WarnerMedia empire. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, both of which launched in November, will add more content throughout the year, too — as will Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Want new seasons of fan favorites ""Search Party"" and ""The Boondocks""? They'll be on HBO Max. It's the final episodes of ""BoJack Horseman"" you crave? Where else but Netflix. Looking for ""The Falcon and the Winter Soldier"" to give you a fix between Marvel movies? Disney Plus has you covered. Finding out when new episodes premiere, let alone whether they're worth watching, will be a task far more complicated than your Twitter feed can keep up with. All these services know they need to offer some reliable hits to complement the new stuff. That means many popular sitcoms are migrating from Netflix.

Services have to charge, whether that's the $5 a month for Apple TV Plus or the $15 for HBO Max. For consumers, that means piling on to a monthly entertainment bill or making tough choices about what to forgo. But don't get too despondent. If some of the recent sitcoms you seek are too unwieldy or costly to find on streaming services, there's a suddenly appealing option: traditional television. Many shows, after all, will continue to air in syndication.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh off an election victory, has vowed to ""get Brexit done."" Brexit will probably not be ""done"" in 2020, but it will — finally — get started. In January, 3 1/2 years after voting narrowly in favor of Brexit, Britain will officially split from the European Union. Expect a big party and fireworks, but don't expect a big rupture in relations between London and Brussels. The status quo will largely continue as the country enters an 11-month transition period, during which Britain will attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the E.U., its largest trading partner, as well as come to agreements on issues including security and law enforcement. Analysts think this is a crazy tight timetable, especially if Johnson wants to diverge substantially from E.U. rules. If a deal isn't completed by the end of the year, it's possible Johnson could break his pledge and seek to extend the transition period. Alternatively, Britain could crash out of the E.U. without a trade pact, reviving anxieties about an abrupt, chaotic and economically damaging ""no-deal"" Brexit.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Or does it tilt toward less regulation, in the spirit of Margaret Thatcher? — is that the prime minister is hard to pin down politically. But he could be tempted to keep Britain more in lockstep with the E.U., not least because his whopping majority means he won't be beholden to Euroskeptics in his party anymore. Plus, closer alignment could help with his political problems in Scotland and Northern Ireland: As the reality of Brexit sinks in, nationalist movements could gain momentum outside England, and a closer relationship with the E.U. could help head off those threats.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It is unclear which U.S. company will be first to market — chicken and duck from Memphis Meats in Berkeley, Calif., with investors such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Tyson Foods; Wagyu beef or chicken nuggets from Just (formerly Hampton Creek), whose investors include Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund; or bluefin tuna from Finless Foods — but Barclays analysts say ""alt meat"" could in the next decade capture 10 percent of the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

These new products are geared toward omnivores and ""flexitarians,"" but as with genetically modified organisms more than a decade ago, some consumers distrust food that has been tinkered with in a laboratory. As it happens, that will also be an issue with another trend this coming year: grocery store foods that are gene-edited with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Romaine and white potatoes that don't brown or bruise, and a gene-edited farmed tilapia that grows quickly, are among the foods improved via tiny DNA snips, essentially accelerating the selection of desirable traits that Gregor Mendel achieved via crossbreeding his peas. Whether consumers will embrace these new foods is unknown. For now, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed overseeing gene-edited animals as drugs, something the meat industry thinks will disadvantage American producers.	7	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Russia has been on a roll in the region, with a winning military intervention in Syria; a strengthening of diplomatic and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel; a mercenary involvement in Libya; and a toe in the waters of the western Mediterranean through joint naval exercises with Algeria. But Moscow's gains have come through craft, stealth and a large measure of luck, rather than through major-power prowess, and the challenge will be to sustain and build on those achievements.	8	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Putin has forged a generally useful working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he may have to start fresh in a post-Netanyahu era, depending on Israel's third round of elections in March. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been receptive to Russian dealmaking, but neither is a client state of Moscow by any measure. And the real key to Russia's Middle Eastern success almost certainly depends on its longtime ally Iran, now shaken by violent protests. In Syria, the Russian military effort has come with little cost and less pain. The real fighting on the ground on behalf of the government of Bashar al-Assad has been carried out by Iran and its Hezbollah allies. But anti-Hezbollah unrest in Lebanon, anti-Iran unrest in Iraq and upheaval on the streets of Iran itself could significantly alter the calculation.	9	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

In 2020, it's expected to issue a report on whether the industry has, in effect, subverted federal antitrust protections. And if Trump loses the White House, the pressure will mount: Democratic contenders, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have promised to unwind some of the mergers that helped the giants become so big in the first place, such as Facebook's purchases of the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging platform WhatsApp. Internet companies spent $55 million over the first nine months of this year to lobby Washington, and they'll throw more political weight around as the threat grows. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg hinted about a fierce counteroffensive in a talk with employees last summer.

Then, the default setting was dread. The expectation was not just for a loss, but a loss that would come in the most excruciating manner imaginable. How will I be kicked in the stomach today? Now? This is new territory, with pain replaced by possibility. Think about how the following sentences would have sounded in, say, December 2017: ""The Capitals are good. Really good. They might be the best team in hockey. They could definitely win the Stanley Cup."" ""The Nationals should be good. Really good.

Because it actually happened. While basketball's Wizards might not be where hockey's Capitals and baseball's Nationals are at the moment — expecting to contend — the environment is such that their rebuilding project seems less laborious and more fun. A slow simmer of anger about another losing season is replaced by the joy of finding hope for the future. Plus, the Mystics won the WNBA title in 2019. We know winning basketball here! It must be noted that the football team exists in a different reality, separate from the rest. It's as if the expectations for Washington sports have been turned around — with the football team left behind. What awaits that outfit in 2020 — a new coach, for sure, and perhaps even new leadership above him — will be monitored closely.

What we know, though, is that the reality has finally met the expectations, and that completely alters what we believe is possible. A fragile boom keeps going and going Although risks remain, the U.S. economy appears unlikely to fall into a recession in 2020. Another year of decent growth will probably make it easier for even more Americans to find jobs — and boost President Trump's chances of reelection.

That's far from the boom that Trump promised and slower than this year's pace of about 2.2 percent and last year's rate of 2.9 percent — but the president and the Federal Reserve may have it in their power to nudge the figure upward. Trump just reached trade agreements with China, Canada and Mexico. The deals are more modest than what he vowed he could achieve, but they signal that he is hitting pause on his trade battles, a welcome relief for Wall Street investors and many business leaders. Although consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip, companies had dramatically scaled back purchases this year because of the trade uncertainty.

Three rate cuts by the Fed in 2019 were a major reason the stock market hit record highs and recession fears abated. Although unemployment is at a 50-year low, the position of the middle class remains precarious. Jobs that pay middle-income wages are increasingly going away, replaced by positions paying over $100,000 or under $30,000. That socially destabilizing phenomenon will be a focus of the presidential race.

Shane Gillis, for example, hired and then fired by ""Saturday Night Live"" for racist language on podcasts, was denounced on social media by celebrities — and also defended by famous comedians. But 2020 may be the year when we learn that no one is canceled forever. The controversies will continue, yes. The society-wide reckoning with sexual harassment and assault won't abate.

He retreated from the limelight for a while, but then he returned to stand-up, doing small shows to work out material before hitting the road to perform in packed theaters. He even addressed the allegation in an acclaimed Netflix special. Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct after the New York Times published allegations from five women, lost his manager, publicist and all of the cultural cachet he had built up in his career. But he had a massive email list pre-scandal, and he can still promote himself to his diehard fans, the ones most likely to have remained as subscribers.

But there will still be audiences willing to watch. Protests won’t stop. Neither will government crackdowns. The motives of the millions who took to the streets in Santiago, La Paz, Algiers and Basra were as varied as their geography. But the demonstrators were united in what has become an epochal display of global discontent, an explosion of popular unrest that capped a decade of angst and anger.

But protesters remain on the streets, demanding a wholesale remaking of the socioeconomic order. Demonstrators in Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Haiti echoed the call for economic justice.

But an entrenched and often corrupt old guard is desperately trying to stay in control. In Iraq, security forces and pro-Iran militias have killed about 500 people and are preparing for a deeper crackdown. Iran hasn't been spared, either. In November, authorities cut off Internet access and killed potentially hundreds to quash protests that erupted after a rise in fuel prices.

President Trump, known more for his coziness with autocrats than commitment to democracy struggles abroad, has been conspicuously silent about most of these displays of people power. But only in a few instances — Hong Kong's American-flag-waving youth come to mind — are any of these movements explicitly calling for U.S. support.

""You have no choice … you're not going to vote for the wealth tax!"" It is a rare admission from a politician. But it's key to a campaign strategy built around an awareness that Trump's favorability — even before he was impeached by the House — is near record lows and that he won't stop tweeting, offering bombast and insults, saying things that aren't true, or making polarizing decisions.

At a briefing with reporters in mid-December, campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner showed data from 2016 indicating that people who said they disapproved of Trump still voted for him.

Officials point to statistics that cut in the president's favor.

Rehnquist added the famous Gilbert-and-Sullivan-inspired gold stripes to his black robe long before he wielded the gavel at President Bill Clinton's Senate impeachment trial in 1999. But he did borrow from the operetta ""Iolanthe"" in describing his role at the trial: ""I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well,"" he told a television interviewer two years later. Now on deck: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The man who made judge-as-umpire his credo during his confirmation hearing would be only the third chief justice to preside at a presidential impeachment trial. It would also be the first trial of any kind where the lawyer turned appellate judge has been in charge.	30	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Although the Supreme Court itself has no formal role in President Trump's impeachment, Trump has, perhaps wishfully, imagined that it might. He tweeted this month: ""Shouldn't even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?"" Trump has also asked the court to protect his financial records from prosecutors and members of Congress, separate from impeachment; the justices will review that question in the spring.	31	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Like Rehnquist, Roberts is a student of history and the Constitution. Rehnquist wrote a book on impeachment; those who've studied the Clinton trial say he was reluctant to make broad rulings that could be overruled by a simple majority of senators. He left it to lawmakers to work out details over motions and witnesses. Roberts, who has chided Trump for suggesting that judges' views are more political bias than studied reasoning, will be looking to preserve his own reputation in a process that by design is more political than legal.	32	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The amount of money spent on presidential campaigns by independent groups rose from almost $129 million in 2008 to nearly $670 million in 2016, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. And essential functions like collecting and analyzing voter data, voter registration drives and spending on political ads are increasingly funded by America's 607 billionaires, outside the direct control of politicians or parties. (One of the richest, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, and in the 2018 cycle, donated $10.1 million to a super PAC supporting military veterans running for office, as well as $52,400 to five other federal PACs and campaigns, according to public records.)	33	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. The president led a conspiracy to use American foreign policy for his personal benefit. We’ve known that much for weeks. Yesterday, we heard a credible accusation that the vice president, among other top officials, was aware of the conspiracy and evidently did nothing to stop it. Imagine for a moment that congressional Republicans were willing to make good on the oath they have all taken to defend the Constitution. In that scenario (fanciful, I realize), both President Trump and Vice President Pence would be at risk of being impeached and removed. This combination would then create a new and separate political crisis.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-11-21	New York Times (Online)	Pence Is Implicated	txt-opeds/2316416991.xml.txt	Why? Because the second person in the presidential line of succession, after the vice president, is the speaker of the House, who is of course currently a Democrat — Nancy Pelosi. If both Trump and Pence were removed from office, Pelosi would become president, flipping partisan control of the White House and the executive branch. That should never happen. A scandal should be able to lead to the removal of individual officials, but it should not reverse which party won an election. “If the electorate says that such-and-such a party should have the White House for four years, it ought to have the White House for four years,” Dwight Eisenhower wisely said.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It creates incentives for one party to exaggerate a scandal (which, to be clear, is not happening in this case). It can also lead to more voters distrusting an impeachment process. “The whole point of having a line of succession is to ensure a smooth transition and a continuity of administration in a time of crisis,” my colleague Jesse Wegman has written. “Having a leader of the opposing party take over the White House, especially in an era of intense political polarization, would not achieve that, to put it mildly.”	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

To listen to them debate, they live in an America saddled with historic wealth inequality, governed by rapacious monopolies, burdened with dirty air and water. This alternate America has human-rights violations and treats women as second-class citizens. Mitch McConnell is the Most Powerful Man on the Planet. The grimmest candidate of all may be Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who dominated Wednesday's debate stage. Ms. Warren is running on her own unique brand of anticorporate populism, one that attacks ""a small group that holds far too much power."" Every problem she sees in America—climate change, guns, student-loan debt, health-care prices, legislative gridlock—is a product of ""systemic"" corruption. Only ""a thinner and thinner slice at the top"" is succeeding, Ms. Warren insisted. Everyone else is failing.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

More than two years later, most of them have forgotten that debate and defaulted to courting the usual urban base. But not Ms. Warren. Her campaign has remained singularly focused on the politics of envy, in a bet that this is the Democratic path to those ""forgotten"" voters. That pitch has had the benefit of distinguishing her ideas rhetorically from Sen. Bernie Sanders's socialist approach. And her growing stack of detailed proposals—from shareholder rules to housing benefits to a wealth tax—has earned her the admiration of the liberal intellectual elite. Columnists and TV hosts are paying her gushy attention, which has helped propel her recent (modest) rise in the polls.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

For all Ms. Warren's recent boomlet, she remains at 12.8% in the latest RealClearPolitics nationwide Democratic average. A central problem with Ms. Warren's strategy was on display with NBC's Savannah Guthrie's opening question to her Wednesday. ""When 71% of Americans say the economy is doing well, including 60% of Democrats,"" Ms. Guthrie asked, ""what do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy?"" She couldn't answer. For the first time in decades, it's harder to hire a blue-collar worker than a white-collar one. Wages are growing, feeding an overall sense of economic optimism. Envy is powerful, and Mr. Trump's tariff-laden economy could still buckle. But it's far tougher to argue the system is rigged when times are good.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Mr. Trump's populism was successful in part because it harnessed a sentiment shared by the vast majority of Americans—distrust of a ""powerful"" and ""corrupt"" political system. He positioned himself outside that power structure, and promised to drain the swamp. Ms. Warren's anticorruption populism sounds good until you hear her fix: Give the feds more power. Many Americans might believe corporations are a problem. But how many think replacing the market with government is the answer? Even Ms. Warren understands the risk. It's why she goes to such effort to insist she is a capitalist and to claim her only interest is in imposing better ""rules"" on the system. But the populist spin can't mask her actual policies. And the agenda she has so meticulously laid out amounts to a ferocious government expansion, unmatched by any candidate other than Mr. Sanders.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

But the result in key states was extremely close. That slim margin says a lot about how U.S. politics has changed over the last 75 years — and perhaps what Biden needs to do to have a successful presidency. Only a narrow margin in four states — Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin — enabled Biden to win. His popular vote margin in those places, like Trump's in 2016, wouldn't fill the Rose Bowl. That the last two presidential elections have been decided by less than 80,000 voters — or 0.025 percent of the population — is a vivid reminder of how closely divided the electorate remains.

We're no longer in the Cold War era, when one party would often capture much of the electoral college map and win the popular vote by double-digit margins. We live in an era of single-digit victories — and close electoral college margins. These down-to-the-wire contests, in turn, make for weak mandates and fragile governing majorities. How we got here It wasn't always this way. In the second half of the 20th century, voters were less partisan and both parties contained liberals and conservatives. That flexibility made a wider range of election outcomes possible, from landslides for either party to more even splits between two candidates.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Voters quickly understood which party they fit into, and which they didn't. As a result, the electoral college map stabilized, and conditions that might have produced landslides in an earlier era produced more moderate victories. Voters still punished presidents who mishandled crises and rewarded those who presided over prosperity, but the wins and losses were more muted compared to past decades. In 2020, that pattern held.

But Biden's victory was too shallow to provide him with a mandate for progressive change, and his coattails were, at best, modest. What should this all mean for a Biden administration? First, Biden should learn from Trump’s bad example. Trump started his term with a tenuous majority in the key electoral college battlegrounds: But Trump alienated voters, acting like a toddler in the Oval Office and mismanaging the coronavirus pandemic. Consciously or not, Trump self-sabotaged, which contributed to his losses. Trump's push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act without offering a clear alternative, and his insistence on cutting taxes for the top income bracket, hurt his reputation as a pathbreaking populist. Biden, who prides himself on being a compromising center-left Democrat, should remember that his reputation isn't safe either, and he could hurt it by supporting too-liberal legislation such as the Green New Deal.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

In the run-up to the election, some Democrats imagined that Biden would win in a blue wave and lead the charge for a wealth tax, expanded health care and a host of other progressive priorities. But Biden has very little room to maneuver. If he loses even a few supporters or alienates any piece of his base, his party could take a beating in the midterms and cracks could form in his 2024 coalition.

Biden has the chance to preside over the pandemic's end by overseeing the distribution of effective vaccines, sending clearer messages on public health , bringing the United States back from a recession by helping restore consumer confidence and acting like a normal president after years of buffoonery. In a past era, those actions might have produced an easy reelection coalition for the Democrats. Biden's work will need to rely on competence and compromise. He could negotiate and pass an economic stimulus package, attempt to work with Republicans and return the United States to prosperity without pushing too far left.

Back in 2014, billionaire venture investor Tom Perkins provided an especially crass example of the genre in a letter to the Wall Street Journal. Perkins wrote: “I would call attention to the parallels of fascist Nazi Germany to its war on its ‘one percent,’ namely its Jews, to the progressive war on the American one percent, namely the ‘rich.’” Cooperman, to his credit, hasn’t gone that far. The wealth tax that so concerns Cooperman and Musk has been proposed in several different forms. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with whom Cooperman waged a somewhat profane war of words in 2019, would have calculated the value of all household assets and levy 2% a year on net worth above $50 million, and a 3% tax on every dollar of net worth above $1 billion.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Tradable assets such as stocks and bonds would be valued every year for the tax, whether they were sold or held; under current law, capital gains are taxed only when they’re sold, and if they’re held until the owner’s death, the embedded tax is extinguished without ever being paid. Since Cooperman has most recently taken up the cudgel against the concept of taxing billionaire wealth, we should give a bit of his history. Cooperman, the son of Polish immigrants, came up in the world via his own bootstraps, with an assist from taxpayers who kept his alma mater, Hunter College in New York City, tuition-free while he studied there. Free tuition ended there in 1976. Cooperman says he has pledged to give away all his fortune to charity.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Cooperman became a partner at Goldman Sachs, then left to start his own hedge fund, Omega Advisors. He was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission with insider trading in 2016. The charges concerned trades Cooperman had made in a pipeline company on behalf of Omega. Cooperman chose to fight the charges but ultimately settled with the SEC for $4.95 million in fines and penalties and an agreement to hire an outside compliance expert to oversee Omega’s activities through this year. Cooperman didn’t admit or deny the charges, and asserted on Bloomberg, “I won the case with the SEC.”	7	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Cooperman’s points, and his historical citations were, to be charitable, selective. He said, with smug satisfaction, that the recent elections showed that “the general populace is not in alignment with the progressives.” Whatever one makes of the elections, the general populace has expressed in opinion polls strong agreement with numerous positions typically labeled “progressives”: Large majorities favor abortion rights, tighter gun control and stricter anti-pandemic policies.	8	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

That these sentiments aren’t reflected in legislation doesn’t indicate that they’ve fallen out of favor, but rather that legislators aren’t in alignment with the populace. In giving Tom Barrack a platform to allegedly promote his United Arab Emirates clients, Bloomberg and Charlie Rose demonstrated the industry’s faults. Asked by his Bloomberg interlocutors about the “vilification of the rich,” one of his recurrent themes, Cooperman said, “I respect Obama as an individual, but he started this whole thing.”	9	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Cooperman overlooks a line of historic rhetoric: Theodore Roosevelt, for example, blasted a broadside at “malefactors of great wealth,” by which he meant E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad and J. P. Morgan, among others, in 1907. Cooperman said the country ought to “coalesce around the question of what should the maximum tax rate be on wealthy people.” He didn’t explain how to do that, but there’s been plenty of evidence of a public consensus over time. The top rate was in the 80%-to-91% range until 1961, when it was applied to income over $400,000 (or $3.7 million in today’s dollars), then 70% until 1981, when it applied to income over $215,400 (about $685,000 today). It’s now 27% on income over $523,600, not counting a net investment surcharge of 3.8% on the wealthy for some investment income.	10	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Cooperman mentioned a rule that favors real estate investors and the carried interest loophole that delivers a tax break to hedge fund operators. (Cooperman’s Omega hedge fund appears now to be mostly his own money, so he’s probably not gaining much if anything from the carried interest rule.) But Cooperman didn’t mention the biggest tax loophole of all: the preferential tax rate on capital gains. That tax tops out at 20%, compared with the tax on wages and other ordinary income, which tops out at 37%. President Biden has proposed raising both top rates to 39.6%, plus the 3.8% net investment surcharge.	11	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-11-16	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Another day, another billionaire whining about a wealth tax	txt-opeds/2597835291.xml.txt	But as I’ve reported, the wealthy would certainly go to the mat to protect their capital gains preference, since they get a disproportionate share of their income from capital assets. An effort to be the first billionaire in space is the biggest vanity project in history. According to the latest Internal Revenue Service statistics, covering the 2019 tax year, taxpayers with $10 million or more in income reported an average of $15 million in income from capital gains. Middle-class taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 to $200,000 reported average capital gains of $10,750. None of the conversation between Cooperman and his Bloomberg interlocutors was especially surprising.

It comes from Herbert Stein, who was Richard Nixon’s chief economist. In a 1996 op-ed for the Wall Street Journal devoted to a debate over how progressive the U.S. tax code should be — that is, how much more of their income the rich should pay than the middle or working class — Stein offered “one law derived from 60 years of observation...: Whatever is the existing degree of progression, people who pay the top rate will think it is too much.”	13	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The formula that led the governor to a landslide win in 2018 — dazzling voters with a technocratic command of facts — doesn't work in today's California. A frazzled electorate wants signs of results, which Newsom apparently hopes to convey by popping up at newly opened vaccination sites. What more could Newsom do to save his job? A good start might be to take some cues from the last man to oust a sitting California governor: Arnold Schwarzenegger, the victor in California's October 2003 recall vote that unseated Democrat Gray Davis. Schwarzenegger, who was reelected in 2006 and term-limited from running again, has natural political instincts that Newsom might find instructive.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Dare to criticize your own side. Four days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, Schwarzenegger released a seven-minute video linking the mindless savagery to Nazi violence and that regime's toll on his childhood Austria. The prominent Republican also defended a ""fair election"" and lambasted then-President Donald Trump (""He will go down in history as the worst president ever""). Schwarzenegger ventured to do what few Republicans dare: buck the prevailing power in the party. Newsom should consider similarly speaking truth to the powerful political entity that intimidates California Democrats: the education establishment. In the Golden State, that includes a Los Angeles-based teachers union that has demanded Medicare-for-all and a new wealth tax, plus a San Francisco school board that deems Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Paul Revere unworthy school namesakes.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

But his silence on the highly publicized and much-criticized matter is grist for the recall mill. Offer an apology (of sorts). In January 2006 and on the heels of a November 2005 special election in which a slate of his ballot measures were soundly rejected, a chastised Schwarzenegger used his annual State of the State address to offer a slice of humble pie (""I have absorbed my defeat and I have learned my lesson"").

He could start by owning up to his leadership failure in violating covid-19 protocols at a swank Napa restaurant when millions of Californians were suffering. (Speaking of dubious judgment, why would a governor besieged by a public health calamity use an hour of his workday to video-chat with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle?) Keep it simple. Newsom tends to spend his news conferences tossing word salads; he might communicate better if added some clarifying Schwarzenegger-style one-liners. It won't be easy — Schwarzenegger is a veteran entertainer.

What that portends: Assuming, as many observers do, that the recall petition succeeds (the deadline for signatures is March 17), next fall will see a more staid election than the one in 2003, with a handful of challengers lacking two assets Schwarzenegger enjoyed, near-universal name recognition and the ability to write themselves eight-figure checks.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

California’s wealthiest residents — who have partaken in a $4-trillion increase in billionaire wealth in the last year — contribute next to nothing to state coffers. Meanwhile, many less fortunate Californians are suffering. The ordinary rich — say, a well-compensated doctor — pay a lot in California income tax; they do their share to help support the state. Indeed, many working-class individuals, such as nurses, teachers or firefighters, pay tax on a much larger share of their economic gains than do the wealthiest Californians.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-04-22	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Op-Ed: California should pass a small tax on big wealth	txt-opeds/2516176606.xml.txt	So how do mega-millionaires and billionaires escape the state’s Franchise Tax Board? The answer is that our tax system does not reach large fortunes unless property is sold or money is paid out in salaries or in stock dividends. Playing Wall Street games, the very rich in the state can avoid taxation and still fund their lavish lifestyles. Consider Elon Musk. He built a fortune in California currently valued at about $180 billion, the largest ever seen in the state. We don’t know exactly how much state income tax he has paid, but because he hasn’t sold his Tesla stock or taken a substantial salary or dividends, we can surmise that he has paid very little. Musk now claims to have moved to Texas, so he will probably never pay income tax to California on the billions he accumulated while benefiting from the services and protections provided by the state.	1	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

With Georgetown University law professor Brian Galle, we helped draft these bills to deter tax avoidance and to restore fairness to California’s tax system. Under these two measures, a household worth $51 million, for example, would pay a tax of $10,000 a year (1% of $1 million). That would be a small burden for such a household but a big boon to California because about one-quarter of all American billionaires reside in the state. As we lay out in a white paper on the legislation, the reforms would raise about $22 billion a year, and more as wealth increases in the state.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Sacramento must invest in climate change resilience, such as power line and power grid upgrades to help prevent catastrophic wildfires. The state’s school systems are facing teacher shortages. Housing and mental health facilities are needed to help those living on our streets. Most fundamentally, it is time to make the tax system fairer. We estimate that about 15,000 families would be subject to the new wealth tax — the richest 0.07% of the state. According to Forbes magazine, there are about 170 California billionaires, and their total wealth is now around $1 trillion. It was only $700 billion two years ago, before COVID-19, and $300 billion 10 years ago.

And yet our research shows that the state has gained millionaires and billionaires, along with added revenue from those earlier taxes on the rich.

Whatever the crisis, whatever the state of the economy, Republicans crave another tax cut for the rich. The latest proposal is for a temporary ""holiday"" on capital gains taxes, as White House adviser Kevin Hassett pitched Sunday on CNN and President Trump had earlier proposed via tweet. A one-time, temporary capital gains tax holiday would do little to stimulate the economy, even according to the GOP's usual line that tax cuts goose growth. The move could, on the other hand, permanently hobble the ability of future presidents to fund the government. A ""capital gain"" refers to how much the value of an asset (such as a stock) has increased over time. Taxes on capital gains are triggered only when the asset is sold. So if you bought a few shares of Apple stock when it IPO'd in 1980, your shares would be worth a fortune today — but you don't owe Uncle Sam a penny until you cash out.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Only a small sliver — about a quarter — of U.S. stock is taxable, because most equities are held in tax-exempt retirement accounts or by tax-exempt nonprofits or foreigners, according to the Tax Policy Center's Steven M. Rosenthal and Lydia Austin. Sales of assets that are taxable are taxed at preferential rates (that is, lower than what you pay on your wage or salary income) if the investments are held for more than a year. The great majority of this taxable investment income accrues to the very richest Americans. Last year, for instance, the top 1 percent of households received three-quarters of all long-term capital gains. So that's the population who'd primarily benefit when the White House suggests further capital gains tax cuts.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

If you happen to die before selling those Apple shares, for example, your kids can inherit them without anyone ever paying income taxes on the gains accumulated during your lifetime. Or, thanks to the GOP's 2017 tax law, you can sell your shares, reinvest the profits into a designated ""Opportunity Zone"" project and have the taxes on your Apple profits postponed or partially forgiven. Even before the pandemic, the White House was proposing additional capital gains tax off-ramps. Now Hassett suggests this new iteration: For some temporary, to-be-determined length of time, rich people could sell their assets, realize whatever gains they've accumulated over the decades, and never pay taxes on the income.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

One possible explanation is self-interest: Some important Republican constituents live off their wealth rather than the sweat of their brows. The GOP is hardly the only party pushing tax breaks that benefit high-income constituents: The Democratic House's latest coronavirus-relief bill, while weighted overall toward lower-income Americans, nonetheless included a tax break that almost exclusively helps high-income, blue-state residents. But Republicans insist that these tax breaks aren't a cynical ploy to reward donors. They're about boosting economic growth! This was also the pitch for their 2017 corporate tax cuts. If only the feds take a smaller cut of investors' returns, Hassett and others argued, investors would provide more capital to companies. Companies would then build more factories and buy more equipment, which would in turn make workers more productive and stimulate long-term economic growth.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It would not actually increase incentives to make new investments. Sure, the lucky guy who bought Apple stock in 1980 can now cash out tax-free. But the policy would do little to change future investment decisions and increase capital accumulation. It's also unlikely to produce much in the way of a Keynesian-style, demand-side stimulus, because the high-income households disproportionately reaping the benefits are more likely to save their windfalls rather than spend them.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

That's because anyone with any unrealized gains today would use the holiday to sell and book those gains now, tax-free, thereby denying the government the ability to ever collect revenue on them. You can't unring the bell. Absent some sort of (possibly unconstitutional) wealth tax, the holiday would deprive the treasury of taxes on the past 50 years or so of accumulated, unrealized capital gains. This would permanently increase deficits, which in the long run would drag economic growth, according to University of Pennsylvania economist and Penn Wharton Budget Model director Kent Smetters.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

Harris is about as mainstream as the mainstream media gets. He spent 21 years at The Washington Post, including as its political editor. Then he became the founding editor of Politico, where he is now a columnist. Last month, Harris wrote a column that I can’t get out of my head. In it, he argued that political journalism suffers from “centrist bias.” As he explained, “This bias is marked by an instinctual suspicion of anything suggesting ideological zealotry, an admiration for difference-splitting, a conviction that politics should be a tidier and more rational process than it usually is.”	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It also helps explain the negative tone running through a lot of the coverage of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders this year. Centrist bias, as I see it, confuses the idea of centrism (which is very much an ideology) with objectivity and fairness. It’s an understandable confusion, because American politics is dominated by the two major parties, one on the left and one on the right.

Over the years, many press critics have pointed out one weakness of this approach: false equivalence, the refusal to consider the possibility that one side of an argument is simply (or mostly) right. But that’s not the only problem. There’s also the possibility that both political parties have been wrong about something and that the solution, rather than being roughly halfway between their answers, is different from what either has been proposing. This seemingly radical possibility turns out to be quite common, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. — author of the classic book, “The Vital Center,” no less — pointed out. The abolition of slavery, women’s suffrage, labor rights, the New Deal, civil rights for black Americans, Reagan’s laissez-faire revolution and same-sex marriage all started outside the boundaries of what either party favored. “The most consequential history,” Harris wrote, “is usually not driven by the center.”	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

This year’s Democratic presidential campaign has been a good case study. The skeptical questions posed to the more moderate Democrats are frequently about style or tactics: Are you too old? Too young? Too rich? Too far behind in the polls? The skeptical questions for the more progressive candidates, Sanders and Warren, often challenge the substance of their ideas: Are you too radical? Are you being realistic? And, by golly, how would you pay for it all? I recently took a detailed look through the coverage of the wealth tax, favored by both Sanders and Warren, and centrist bias seeps through much of it.

Not every policy question posed to Democrats needs to have a conservative assumption, and not every question posed to Republicans needs to have a liberal one. If Warren and Sanders are going to be asked whether their solutions go too far, Joe Biden should be asked whether his solutions are too timid: Mr. Vice President, many economists believe that inequality is bad for an economy, so are you doing enough to attack inequality? Once you start thinking about centrist bias, you recognize a lot of it. It helps explain why the 2016 presidential debates focused more on the budget deficit, a topic of centrist zealotry, than climate change, almost certainly a bigger threat. (Well-funded deficit advocacy plays a role too.) Centrist bias also helps explain the credulousness of early coverage during the Iraq and Vietnam wars.

So says Faiz Shakir of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent whose recent heart attack has perplexed some voters in the Democratic primaries. As manager of the Sanders presidential campaign, Shakir wants to reassure those voters that the 78-year-old candidate is in it for the long haul, even if that means munching kale. In addition to taking long walks and wearing natty sweaters, the rumpled revolutionary is being advised to comb his hair occasionally in the effort to project a robust glow. But now it appears the senator's vigor won't be tested as sternly as anticipated. Sanders is likely to spend much of the primary crunch time in a comfortable chair along with five of his fellow candidates whose day jobs are in the U.S. Senate.

A trial that chews up most of January and February will do more for Sanders than a bushel of salad greens. His base of support is smaller than it was when the race began, but it's all muscle. He has raised more money and draws bigger crowds than his competitors, which makes him a factor — though not a favorite — for as long as he remains viable.

Stiglitz combines passion and intellect to compose an excellent summary of the inequality issue. Other concerned economists and political thinkers should now move forward. Mr. Stiglitz cites Thomas Piketty’s “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” and its main theme: that the three decades after World War II, when the income division was much narrower, were an anomaly in the history of capitalism. In Mr. Piketty’s opinion the solution to current inequality is a global wealth tax. There are no doubt other economically and politically feasible answers. Niall Ferguson on the conservative side and Robert B. Reich on the liberal side, among others, have suggested potential ways to reduce inequality. But the question remains: Why is there no political will to implement any solutions, whatever they may be?

THEO GALLIER Ashland, Ore., June 29, 2014 Joseph E. Stiglitz astutely points out that “justice has become a commodity, affordable only to the few.” Indeed, the growing chasm between the rich and the poor is especially stark in our justice system, where the wealthy can afford high-quality legal representation and many others must navigate complex legal proceedings alone. Recent studies have consistently found that 80 percent of civil legal needs of low-income Americans go unmet, even when they face potentially life-changing situations such as evictions and foreclosures, child custody hearings, and the loss of health care and other vital public benefits.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Over several decades, U.S. policies have facilitated a systematic upward redistribution of wealth. Congress has slashed taxes overall, but especially on the rich; reduced or eliminated brackets that applied only to the tippy-top income percentiles, making the tax code less progressive at the top; neutered the estate tax; cut rates on long-term capital gains; added ""Inception""-like loopholes within loopholes, which disproportionately benefit taxpayers with the sophistication and resources to game the system; and gutted the Internal Revenue Service, which catches these tax dodgers.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

While some may see a wealth tax as an attempt to act out the left's pitchforkiest fantasies, we might instead think of it as a way to correct the mistakes of the past. It's hard to unwind 40 years of bad tax policy by jacking up marginal rates on ordinary income alone. The Trump family makes a good poster child for why: Adding a new 70 percent marginal tax rate on income above $10 million, for instance, would barely dent the accumulated wealth passed down — much of it untaxed — from Fred Trump to Donald to Ivanka and subsequent generations.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Some legal scholars, including a group assembled by Warren, argue that a wealth tax would hold up to a constitutional challenge. But with the current Supreme Court, that's far from guaranteed. There are other hitches, too, some specific to Warren's (relatively barebones) formulation: a 2 percent annual tax on a household's wealth above $50 million, with the rate rising to 3 percent on any wealth above $1 billion. Some obvious ways to game that $50 million threshold trigger include strategic divorce, within-family transfers and tricks for deflating valuations.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

As tax practitioners who've appraised large estates could tell you, mark-to-market valuations of highly illiquid assets (closely held businesses, rare works of art) are easily manipulated. Warren proposes handling this by beefing up tax enforcement, through greater IRS funding, for example. That's something we should absolutely do anyway, but it's not clear manpower alone would be enough. These problems are not insurmountable, however. As tax experts such as University of Chicago law professor Daniel Hemel have suggested, you could reconfigure parts of the income tax to create something that effectively operates like Warren's wealth tax, except with fewer constitutional or administrative headaches.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

It could shore up the estate tax and repeal the ""stepped-up basis"" that allows unrealized capital gains to go untaxed when a person dies. Raising the capital-gains rate might encourage rich people to delay sales of assets. But Congress could claw back these deferral benefits, through something called a retrospective wealth tax. It's a bit complicated, but it's like charging interest for the years you held an asset before selling it (or dying). Nobel laureate William Vickrey proposed a version of this 80 years ago, and it has since been tweaked by Alan Auerbach and David Bradford.

This is hardly a Republican talking point, as Rahm Emanuel, former Democratic mayor of Chicago and chief of staff for Obama, put it on Sunday. ""Well, look, here's the thing.

2019-11-04	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s attack on moderate Democrats isn’t a good idea	txt-opeds/2311831452.xml.txt	At the heart of the debate is whether Warren has used smoke-and-mirrors calculations to disguise a reality that just about every independent analyst (and many Democrats) know: You cannot do this without hitting the middle class. Ron Brownstein points out: Warren's estimate is considerably lower than most projections for a single-payer system, as her team acknowledged in its own analysis of the plan. Even at a flat $20 trillion, such a plan would cost more than the federal government now spends on Social Security alone or on Medicare and Medicaid combined. ... That gap matters so much because it probably determines whether a single-payer plan can be financed without raising taxes on the middle class, as Warren has pledged. The financing proposals she outlined Friday did not directly hit middle-class taxpayers, but those provisions wouldn't come close to covering the full cost of her plan if the actual price tag is closer to those other studies' estimates.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Warren is also terribly cavalier about the impact that her plan has on working- and middle-class people. Asked what all the health-care insurance company workers would do if their business was outlawed, she blithely said they could go work in other areas of insurance — as if thousands upon thousands of jobs are waiting to be filled with refugees from health-care insurance companies. Part of her scheme for keeping the cost down is her unrealistic assumptions about the amount of cost she can wring out of doctors, hospitals and drug and device manufacturers. A co-author of the Urban Institute study tells Brownstein, ""We are talking about very sizable average decreases across the country in what hospitals are being paid. . . .We thought 115 percent [of Medicare] was pretty aggressive and optimistic."" (Warren offers 110 percent.) You can squeeze hospitals and doctors as much as you want, but some will close up shop, skimp on patient time, and lay off or cut wages of nurses and technicians (and other middle- and low-wage earners).	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

It will be up to Democrats who favor much more reasonable plans to make the case that hocus pocus proposals do real damage to the effort to obtain important, winnable improvements in our health-care system. Left-wing populism that promises painless solutions to vastly complex problems sets voters up for disappointment, erodes credibility in government and spreads the same kind of cynicism that comes from proposals such as President Trump's mythical health-care plan that was going to be so much better than Obamacare.

The plan is light on details, but leaves the senator at least $12.5 trillion short of covering the cost of his health-care proposal over 10 years. It calls for some tax increases on working families, but the real burden may be much higher than advertised: Mr. Sanders may have to raise taxes on American workers by 16 percentage points or more to avoid multitrillion-dollar deficits. Fortunately, Elizabeth Warren's financing plan for Medicare for All offers a better alternative. Mr. Sanders's blueprint identifies $17.5 trillion in new federal revenue over the next 10 years, sourced to new or higher taxes on workers and corporations, among other changes to the code. Mr. Sanders bases his calculations on a study by Yale researchers published recently in the Lancet, which found that his plan would reduce national health spending from $52 trillion over a decade to $47 trillion. Mr. Sanders claims he will redirect the current projected $30 trillion in federal, state and local health-care spending over the next decade to Medicare for All. Thus, he says he only needs $17 trillion to fill the gap.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

First, the Yale study didn't account for the cost of Mr. Sanders's long-term care program—estimated at around $2.5 trillion. Second, the study assumed reimbursement cuts to hospitals that Mr. Sanders hasn't explicitly endorsed. Third, Mr. Sanders's $30 trillion in projected federal spending includes funding for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and more. This money can't be spent on Medicare for All unless it is zeroed out from these vital public-health agencies. Most analyses have found that the Sanders Medicare for All proposal would require around $30 trillion in new federal spending over a decade. That leaves Mr. Sanders $12.5 trillion short of what he needs to cover the cost of his plan.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

His plan includes two proposals that affect middle-class families. One is a 4% ""income-based premium"" on workers, which excludes the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. This ""premium"" would be an additional tax on income above the exclusion floor, and presumably even less income would be excluded for single workers or those without children. The senator says this tax will generate $4 trillion over 10 years. To make up the $12.5 trillion shortfall, that tax would need to be roughly four times as large—the equivalent of a tax increase of 16% of income.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Mr. Sanders estimates this would generate $5.2 trillion over 10 years. To generate the missing $12.5 trillion, that payroll tax rate would need to reach roughly 26.5%. And while the employer receives the bill, higher payroll taxes are mostly passed on to workers in lower wages, reduced hours or both. Mr. Sanders could raise taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. But he already plans to do that: His financing for Medicare for All and other plans includes a wealth tax, a substantial corporate tax increase, a financial-transactions tax, an increase in the top personal tax rate, and a capital-gains tax increase. There isn't room to squeeze trillions in additional revenue out of these sources.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

This is plausible in the aggregate at certain income levels. But it is implausible that every middle-class family will come out ahead—especially if the plan is fully paid for in taxes. The plan Ms. Warren released in October addresses these vulnerabilities. Unlike Mr. Sanders's plan, it commits to specific reimbursement rates for health-care providers—roughly 110% of current Medicare rates. Her plan brings the overall cost of Medicare for All down to $20.5 trillion over 10 years, according to an analysis I did with Donald Berwick, who ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama. Ms. Warren's plan doesn't raise taxes on the middle class. Every business that pays for employee health insurance today will pay less for each employee during the transition.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

2021-10-29	New York Times (Online)	A Billionaire’s Tax Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds	txt-opeds/2587604160.xml.txt	This article is co-published with ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. It has been updated to reflect news events. Having stumbled in their attempts to raise taxes on the wealthy in the conventional way, Democrats in Congress moved to unconventional measures. The proposal was to tax billionaires on their so-called unrealized gains — the growth in the value of assets, such as stocks and real estate, that have not yet been sold. To understand why lawmakers might look to a group of more than 700 billionaires to underwrite a massive spending program, consider this statistic: Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, billionaires have seen a 70 percent increase in their wealth, from nearly $3 trillion to an almost incomprehensible $5 trillion, according to Forbes data analyzed by Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies Program on Inequality and the Common Good.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-29	New York Times (Online)	A Billionaire’s Tax Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds	txt-opeds/2587604160.xml.txt	Unsurprisingly, critics, the ultrawealthy and even some Democrats decried the idea as novel, untested and dangerous. Other experts worried about whether it would be too difficult to value billionaires’ assets or if the proposal could pass constitutional muster. These attacks ultimately killed the idea in Washington. But a billionaire’s tax is not nearly as novel and untested as it sounds. The main concepts already exist in the tax code. It just happens that these provisions currently serve the interests of the ultrawealthy class, who have so far skirted most taxes aimed at wealth rather than income. The ultrawealthy live starkly different financial lives from other people. They hardly make anything in wages, or what the rest of us know as income. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos has typically pulled down a middle-class base salary of around $80,000. Others, like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and Google’s Larry Page, have, at various points, taken a symbolic $1 in salary.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-10-29	New York Times (Online)	A Billionaire’s Tax Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds	txt-opeds/2587604160.xml.txt	But many ultrawealthy Americans have figured out how to fund a lavish lifestyle without owing any income tax. Their wealth is almost entirely in assets like stocks, such as the Tesla shares that account for the vast majority of Elon Musk’s $270 billion plus in wealth. Our tax code levies a 23.8 percent tax on capital gains for those with the highest incomes, but only when an asset is sold. Their holdings can grow by billions of dollars a year, but the wealthy owe nothing as long as they hang on to their shares. When they need money, they borrow it, as Mr. Ellison and Mr. Musk have done to the tune of billions, pledging the value of shares as collateral. It has been called “Buy, Borrow, Die,” and it’s a wonderful system for the superrich.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-29	New York Times (Online)	A Billionaire’s Tax Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds	txt-opeds/2587604160.xml.txt	This system allows them to enjoy luxury cars, yachts, homes on multiple continents and occasional trips to outer space while reporting, in some cases, a salary of a dollar a year or less to the Internal Revenue Service. This is why the ultrawealthy are able to pay negligible amounts in taxes, especially compared with the growth in their wealth, as ProPublica reported earlier this year, as part of our series “The Secret I.R.S. Files.” In 2018, Mr. Musk paid $0 in federal income taxes. (He declined to discuss his taxes with ProPublica.) The proposal would have taxed billionaires on those unrealized gains. If shares of Amazon or Facebook or Berkshire Hathaway rise 20 percent in a year, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg or Warren Buffett, respectively, would owe taxes on that gain — even if they don’t sell a single share. Assets that are harder to value, such as privately held companies or real estate, would also be subject to tax.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-10-29	New York Times (Online)	A Billionaire’s Tax Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds	txt-opeds/2587604160.xml.txt	Part of the objection to the billionaire’s tax was that it is a dramatic change from the current tax system, which taxes people only when they realize gains. That’s untrue. There are several provisions in the current tax code through which unrealized gains are taxed. Here’s one example of something in the code today. Certain hedge fund managers can do what’s called a 475 election, a maneuver named after Section 475 of the tax code. Using this provision, their entire fund is taxed on its market value at the end of the year. They have to pay taxes on gains, whether they sell the underlying stock or not. Are these hedge fund managers nuts? Nope. They do it because it confers several benefits for certain types of funds (particularly those doing rapid-fire trading every nanosecond), including freeing them from complying with trading rules they may find onerous.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-10-29	New York Times (Online)	A Billionaire’s Tax Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds	txt-opeds/2587604160.xml.txt	Hedge fund managers are intimately familiar with the concept of placing a value on unrealized gains. Their compensation depends on it. Each year, they get a small percentage, typically 2 percent, of the assets they manage. If they do well and the fund goes up, they get a performance fee, often 20 percent of the increase in the fund’s value. How do they determine that 20 percent? They figure out the unrealized gains. On Dec. 31, they tell their clients that their assets went up and get paid 20 percent of that amount. If those stocks fall on Jan. 1, they don’t have to give the money back.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-29	New York Times (Online)	A Billionaire’s Tax Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds	txt-opeds/2587604160.xml.txt	The mirror image of unrealized gains also exists in the tax code. Today, businesses that buy equipment get to take a deduction intended to approximate the amount that it loses in value each year. This concept is called depreciation. In other words, you get a deduction based on an estimate, not when you sell something. You could call it an unrealized loss. And then there’s the wealth tax on unrealized gains that millions of Americans already pay: property taxes, which every owner of a house or apartment is responsible for. Property taxes are a town or city’s estimate of the value of your home or land, almost always in a year you didn’t sell.	6	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE
2021-10-29	New York Times (Online)	A Billionaire’s Tax Isn’t as Crazy as It Sounds	txt-opeds/2587604160.xml.txt	The proposal is not a wealth tax, but it has a similar goal of raising money only from the ultrawealthy. Its elegance is that it equates the gain in wealth with income. In theory, a wealth tax, which has its own complexities and constitutional questions, could be layered on top. When people complain that the new billionaire tax is unconstitutional, they may be forgetting about all of these provisions that exist today that do similar things. Another argument against such a tax is that it would be too hard to enforce because it’s difficult to value assets accurately. Stock markets reflect a clear value for publicly held companies, but the value of privately held companies, real estate holdings, art and other assets is harder to determine.	7	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Commercial real estate, for example, relies on the work of research and investment banking companies that analyze and value office buildings. And if banks are willing to lend to the ultrawealthy against their assets, presumably they are comfortable valuing them. If all these entities can do it, so can the I.R.S. It’s a measure of how much the political conversation about wealth inequality has shifted that this new tax was even considered seriously. While a tax on billionaires for their unrealized gains is not as new as people want to pretend, it clearly would be complex to implement. Perhaps, however, not as complex as getting all Democrats on board.	8	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), written off by the chattering class earlier in the year as ""unelectable,"" now sits at the top of several polls in the first two state contests' polling and a whisker behind former vice president Joe Biden in national polling (less than two points in the RealClearPolitics average). Solid fundraising, substantial organization on the ground in early states and a work ethic second to none make her a formidable candidate. Her consistent focus on fighting corruption is well-attuned to the Trump era. In the CBS News-YouGov poll released on Sunday, Warren and Biden are tied in Iowa at 22 percent, statistically tied with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) who is at 21 percent. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the only other candidate in double digits (14 percent). Voters in this poll still say Biden's electability against President Trump (""probably would win"") outpaces Warren (68 vs. 51 percent), and more voters think Biden will protect Americans ""very well"" from terrorism (58 vs. 49 percent).

There, too, Biden does better on electability and ability to keep Americans safe. Meanwhile, Biden holds a commanding lead in South Carolina (43 vs. 18 percent) over Warren. Warren now faces the challenges that come with front-runner status, including dealing with high expectations for the early primaries and being the target of attacks from opponents and of criticism from the media. She has yet to be strongly challenged on the debate stage on the math for her wealth tax, the funding for her Medicare-for-all plan and her views on national security. Although she has shown steady improvement with African American and non-college-educated voters, her support still rests mostly on college-educated white progressives.

Consistent work in reaching out to African American voters (without the kind of unrealistic promises they have, over decades, learned to view with extreme skepticism) can help increase her appeal with the most critical Democratic bloc in the primaries. Beyond that, Warren might plan to take the wind out of the predictable attacks she will face. First, she still faces the commander in chief test, a requirement of any presidential candidate but especially so in light of Trump's mismanagement of national security from North Korea to Russia to Saudi Arabia to China. Warren would do well to issue a robust condemnation of Trump's retreat from Syria and explain how she would wind down ""forever wars"" without endangering allies, giving a shot in the arm to Islamic State terrorists and losing allies' confidence. Will she be guided by conditions on the ground? How will she reestablish U.S. credibility with allies? On China, she needs to articulate a policy that distinguishes her from Trump and communicates seriousness about protecting American values and interests. Democratic voters might not put national security at the top of their list of concerns, but polls repeatedly show voters remain concerned about terrorism and keeping our alliances strong.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

When Medicare-for-all proves to be unattainable, does she have a backup plan? If she cannot raise enough revenue from her wealth tax, what does she do with her assortment of domestic programs? Trump made promises in 2016 he could not keep: getting Mexico to pay for the wall, coming up with a cheaper but better health-care plan and developing a tax cut that wouldn't make the rich even richer. One of Democrats' best lines of attack is that Trump not only did not produce for the ""forgotten man and women,"" but he also made life harder for them.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

But it certainly hasn’t been equally disastrous for everyone. If you thought the wealth gap between Ebenezer Scrooge and Bob Cratchit was vast in “A Christmas Carol,” the difference between the haves and have-nots in 2020 would be enough to make Charles Dickens’ head spin. What would Dickens write about today’s America, where the total wealth gains of America’s 650 billionaires have surpassed $1 trillion since March? Where Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune increase by $72 billion during the pandemic, while Amazon faces intense criticism for failing to keep its workers safe even as thousands of them fall ill?

As the pandemic hands windfall profits to the billionaire class, our nation’s charities, particularly those serving the disadvantaged, are running out of money.

The idea is to set standards for the minimum level of annual giving from America’s wealthiest individuals and foundations so that more money can flow to organizations that can put those funds to work right away. Those who meet the benchmark would set a powerful example for what philanthropy should be doing in this time of national crisis. The math is relatively simple. The wealthiest 0.1% have an estimated tax base of around $11 trillion, but give away only around 1% annually to charity. An additional $1 trillion is parked in private foundations (where only 5% annually has to go to charities) and donor-advised funds — for which wealthy contributors can enjoy tax benefits from both of as much as 74% (and even more in high-income-tax states like California).	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

The formula, like wealth tax proposals at the federal and state levels, is based on asset brackets, with higher percentages in higher brackets. For example, an individual with $500 million in assets should give a minimum of $13.25 million annually (donation levels rise significantly higher up the wealth ladder).

Elon Musk, worth $167 billion, should be giving $8.1 billion. Mark Zuckerberg, worth $105 billion, should be giving $5 billion. Collectively, applying the CCC formula, these three would donate more than $22 billion in 2020. This would be a small share of their wealth, given that combined they’ve made an astronomical $267 billion during the pandemic. But it would undoubtedly make a huge difference to struggling charities.

That’s one potential lesson from the 2020 Bloomberg campaign, a 101-day billionaire media supernova that burned hot and fast — and through upward of $500 million in mostly ad money — but won no states in the primary contest. (At least Mike Bloomberg can expect a warm welcome the next time he visits American Samoa.) One way to look at the Bloomberg campaign is as proof that attention-hacking digital and media strategies are mostly hot air — a quadrennial transfer of money from campaigns to creative consultants and media outlets that’s hyped but not all that productive. If $500 million can’t win you one state in the primary, what does that say about the Trump campaign digital ad juggernaut Democrats are terrified to go up against? Just how effective are all those pesky, political ads Facebook refuses to fact check?	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-03-04	New York Times (Online)	Bloomberg’s $500 Million Experiment Worked	txt-opeds/2370728599.xml.txt	But to look only at number of states won obscures the marvel of the Bloomberg experiment, in which name recognition and an unlimited war chest helped elevate a candidate polling nationally at less than 3 percent on the day he announced to around 16 percent by the end of February. It allowed a less than charismatic campaigner with stop-and-frisk and nondisclosure agreement baggage who skipped the first four nominating states to still manage to crack 10 percent of the vote in nearly all of the Super Tuesday contests. If there’s a lesson to draw from Mr. Bloomberg’s media extravaganza it seems to be, as The Atlantic’s McKay Coppins remarked, “how close it came to working.”	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-03-04	New York Times (Online)	Bloomberg’s $500 Million Experiment Worked	txt-opeds/2370728599.xml.txt	In barely three months, Mr. Bloomberg built a national media apparatus that sucked up huge amounts of politics’ most precious and finite resource: attention. He managed to attack the left wing of the Democratic Party without damaging those in its center, and he provided a blueprint for how a Democrat with more raw appeal and connection to voters could compete with the Trump campaign’s audacity online. The strategy — however cynical — worked, even if the candidate didn’t. “The fact that he got to where he did is a baseline testament to the effectiveness of ads,” a strategist working on another presidential campaign told me Wednesday. They described the Bloomberg campaign as “a political science experiment” seeking to answer the (once hypothetical) question, “What does a campaign with every resource it could need and more do?”	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-03-04	New York Times (Online)	Bloomberg’s $500 Million Experiment Worked	txt-opeds/2370728599.xml.txt	The campaign’s shamelessness and limitless resources were perhaps helpful in establishing a blueprint for media strategy in the general election. The campaign showed that a pugnacious strategy on Twitter against Donald Trump nets cable news headlines, high engagement and excites those whose sole goal is messing with the president. Its recruitment of online influencers — specifically its flooding the zone with memes on private Instagram accounts — forced major internet platforms to scramble to address outdated transparency rules. For Democrats taking notes, it’s undoubtedly helpful to see just how far paying millennial and Gen Z meme accounts to shill for a septuagenarian will get you.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But, as any creative executive will tell you, marketing eventually has to collide with a product people want to buy. If it doesn’t, it plateaus in effectiveness. “In Mr. Bloomberg’s case, the product was bad,” Shomik Dutta, an Obama campaign vet and the chief executive of Higher Ground Labs, told me. “Over 20 million Democratic voters watched that first debate with him and I think there was a ‘Wizard of Oz’ moment for all of them: ‘That’s the guy behind the curtain?’ The advertising did still work, though — look at his numbers before the fall from grace.”	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But both events, as Mr. Fallon noted, enlisted the help of the same influencer marketing firm. Others suggest that Mr. Bloomberg’s money bomb would have been more effective if it were tailored more toward collecting voter information to build good will. “The Trump campaign runs a very tight ship that is driven by data and analytics,” Reid Vineis, vice president for digital operations at Majority Strategies, a Republican consulting firm, told me. “The Trump campaign is also extremely well funded like Mike Bloomberg.

It will clearly be smaller than President Biden’s original proposal, and much smaller than what progressives wanted. It will, however, be infinitely bigger than what Republicans would have done, because if the G.O.P. controlled Congress, we would be doing nothing at all to invest in America’s future. But what will the plan do? Far too much reporting has focused mainly on the headline spending number — $3.5 trillion, no, $1.5 trillion, whatever — without saying much about the policies this spending would support. To be fair, though, the Biden administration could have done a better job of summarizing its plans in pithy slogans.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-25	New York Times (Online)	Tax the Rich, Help America’s Children	txt-opeds/2585578520.xml.txt	So let me propose a one-liner: Tax the rich, help America’s children. This gets at much of what the legislation is likely to do: Reporting suggests that the final bill will include taxes on billionaires’ incomes and minimum taxes for corporations, along with a number of child-oriented programs. And action on climate change can, reasonably, be considered another way of helping future generations. Republicans will, of course, denounce whatever Democrats come out with. But there are three things you should know about both taxing the rich and helping children: They’re very good ideas from an economic point of view. They’re extremely popular.

2021-10-25	New York Times (Online)	Tax the Rich, Help America’s Children	txt-opeds/2585578520.xml.txt	About the economics: Although the modern Republican Party is utterly committed to the proposition that low taxes on corporations and the rich are the key to economic success, there is no evidence that this is true. If anything, the historical correlation runs the other way. The U.S. economy grew faster during periods when taxes at the top were relatively high than it did when they were low. On the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence that helping children, in addition to being the right thing to do, has big economic payoffs. Children who benefited from safety-net programs like food stamps became healthier, more productive adults. Children who were enrolled in pre-K education were more likely to graduate from high school and go to college than those who weren’t. As I’ve argued in the past, the economic case for investing in children is even stronger than the case for investing in physical infrastructure.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-25	New York Times (Online)	Tax the Rich, Help America’s Children	txt-opeds/2585578520.xml.txt	When it comes to public opinion, what’s striking is how little impact more than 40 years of anti-tax, anti-government propaganda has had on voters’ views. Polls consistently show large majorities, including many Republicans, supporting higher taxes on corporations and the rich. Large majorities also support subsidizing child care and aiding families with children. It’s true that anti-government politicians often win elections — but they do so, with rare exceptions, not because the public buys into libertarianism but because white voters can sometimes be persuaded that government programs benefit only people of color. Finally, while Republican politicians routinely claim that Democrats are anti-American and that Democratic proposals are Marxist, history tells us that the key elements of the legislation we’re probably about to see — aid to middle-class and poor children together with higher taxes on the wealthy — are quintessentially American ideas.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-10-25	New York Times (Online)	Tax the Rich, Help America’s Children	txt-opeds/2585578520.xml.txt	Remember, we are the nation that basically invented universal education. Thomas Jefferson called for publicly funded schools even in the midst of the Revolutionary War (yes, only for whites, but still). In the 19th century, America led the way in creating “common schools” that were meant to include students from all social classes, and were justified by many of the same arguments now being made for universal pre-K and other forms of aid to children. So when Republicans denounce pro-child policies as socialist and try to promote private schools, they, not Democrats, are rejecting our nation’s traditions. And guess what: We are also, arguably, the nation that invented progressive taxation. America has had progressive income taxes and estate taxes — that is, taxes that are levied at a higher rate on large incomes and estates — since 1916.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-25	New York Times (Online)	Tax the Rich, Help America’s Children	txt-opeds/2585578520.xml.txt	It’s notable that the early proponents of these taxes didn’t view them simply as ways to raise revenue. They also explicitly called for taxes on the wealthy as a way to limit inequality, and in particular to prevent the emergence of a hereditary oligarchy. Thus in 1905 Theodore Roosevelt argued that it was essential to prevent the “inheritance or transmission in their entirety” of “fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits,” and in 1907 he called for a “heavy progressive tax” on estates to achieve this goal. A modern U.S. politician who said anything similar would be accused of engaging in un-American class warfare. But if this be class warfare, make the most of it; like spending to help children from lower-income families, progressive taxation is as American as apple pie.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Kyrsten Sinema successfully blocks key tax increases at the core of President Biden's agenda, as she reportedly aims to do, guess who some of the biggest winners will be? The top 1 percent, who have done fabulously well throughout much of the contemporary era. The Arizona Democrat reportedly opposes raising corporate tax rates and high-end income taxes, a major hurdle as Democrats negotiate a deal on Biden's multitrillion-dollar social policy bill. How bad is this? It's pretty bad. In addition to offsetting the plan's spending on health care, education, child care and other important public goods, these reforms are critical to rebalancing our badly out-of-whack political economy. That in turn is needed to restore a sense that liberal democracy can deliver amid rising illiberalism and authoritarianism.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-10-21	The Washington Post (Online)	Sinema’s attack on Biden’s tax plan may be great news for the 1 percent	txt-opeds/2584138974.xml.txt	According to new reports, Sinema is balking at raising the corporate tax rate, which would mean keeping it at 21 percent after the 2017 GOP tax cut chopped it down from 35 percent. She also reportedly opposes raising the rate on top individual income earners a mere two points, to 39 percent. In response, Democrats are eyeing other ways to tax corporations and the rich. They include beefed-up IRS enforcement against wealthy tax cheats, joining a global minimum tax deal that would capture revenue from profit-shifting multinationals, and taxes on corporate stock buybacks and on billionaires' wealth. Let's be clear: Those will do a lot of good. But a failure to raise corporate and high-end income rates would fritter away a chance to make major strides toward a fairer economy.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The standard argument for low corporate tax rates — one that Sinema probably adheres to — is that this results in more socially constructive corporate investment and job creation. But here the big winners will likely be wealthy stockholders and other holders of capital and well-heeled professionals. Without more detail, precise impacts are elusive, but at my request, Tax Policy Center senior fellow Steven M. Rosenthal sketched out the broad strokes. The crucial point, Rosenthal notes, is that corporate tax hikes tend to fall immediately on stockholders, who have done extremely well in recent years. So failing to raise corporate tax rates — when combined with failing to raise higher income rates — would end up exempting a large swath of the 1 percent from tax hikes.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Here's the rub: Rather than tax wealthy capital-owners and professionals as a broad class, Democrats' substitute measures would likely target a much narrower slice of that class while simultaneously netting more from the fabulously, insanely wealthy, Rosenthal says. How much money are we talking about in the reforms Sinema opposes? The Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed the impact of some of the high-end income tax hikes being considered — including a hike on income taxes for those earning over $400,000 per year and on the capital gains tax, which Sinema also reportedly opposes.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Sinema presumably wants much of that to go untouched. Many wealthy people would benefit. ""The individual rate increases would fall on law firms partners, hedge fund managers, private equity investors and other high earning taxpayers,"" Rosenthal tells me. Sinema's office is not confirming or denying these reports, though she has apparently detailed her objections to the White House. But the reporting does indicate that Democrats are scrambling to reemphasize these alternatives in response to her stance. So how much ground will these alternatives make up? They would miss a large chunk of those taxpayers.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Similarly, taxing stock buybacks would target corporate executives and shareholders, which would ""collect more corporate taxes, but not nearly as much as a corporate rate increase."" What about the billionaire wealth tax that Democrats are considering? It would require those with $1 billion in assets or $100 million in annual income to pay annual taxes on assets such as stocks. But as Rosenthal notes, this would not hit many people at all, mainly ""entrepreneurs who founded phenomenally successful companies and are now immensely wealthy.""	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

While a much smaller, stratospherically wealthy class would be targeted, large swath of very wealthy shareholders, owners of capital and rentier-class professional types would emerge untouched: ""Investors, capital holders, and high-income professionals,"" Rosenthal says. ""These are overwhelmingly 1 percenters."" What's galling is that the vast imbalance of this moment partly resulted from policy choices. First, there's that GOP cut in corporate tax rates. As Jonathan Chait notes, Sinema voted against this, and since then, it has not produced promised benefits for society or the working class, so why wouldn't Sinema want to undo it now?	6	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Perhaps not entirely, I'll grant you. One reason ""Socialist!"" isn't the powerful insult it once was is just time: Since the Soviet Union collapsed almost three decades ago, there are a couple of generations of Americans who have no memory of the Cold War. For them, socialism is not synonymous with communism, which anyway is just something they learned about in history class. They don't view it as the ideology of our enemies. But more importantly, in the time since, Republicans have attacked almost anything Democrats wanted to do as socialism. Modest tax increases on the wealthy? Socialism!

In other words, they've accepted the Republican view of what socialism is.

2023-01-26	Wall Street Journal (Online)	Washington State's Tax Ban Goes to Court; Progressives think they have finally found a way to overrule the voters.	txt-opeds/2769641966.xml.txt	Washington state has been one of only nine states without a personal income tax, and progressives finally think they've found a way to leap over voters and impose one. Their gambit heads to the state Supreme Court on Thursday, and it should die there unless the judges misread the state constitution. Washington has dodged an income tax thanks to a 1930 constitutional provision that bans graduated taxes on property and broadly defines property to include money. The constitution specifies that ""the word 'property' as used herein shall mean and include everything, whether tangible or intangible, subject to ownership."" The provision has withstood previous attempts to end run it. The Supreme Court overturned a Depression-era ballot measure to impose an income tax. Six times in recent years the Legislature passed constitutional amendments to allow an income tax and asked voters to approve it on the ballot. Six times voters said no. They've also rejected four citizen-initiated ballot measures on the question.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The hope is that a tax on gains from the sale of assets will somehow win the Supreme Court's approval. In a 2018 email, Washington Sen. Jamie Pedersen wrote that the capital-gains tax would be challenged in court and give the Justices a chance to overturn their tax precedents. ""The other side will challenge it as an unconstitutional property tax,"" Mr. Pedersen wrote. ""This will give the Supreme Court the opportunity to revisit its bad decisions . . . and will make it possible, if we succeed, to enact a progressive income tax with a simple majority vote."" Washington Democrats are waiting to strike with proposals for broad-based taxes on income and property, including a 1% wealth tax.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

But an excise tax is levied on various goods and services, such as fuel or alcohol. According to the Washington Policy Center, every state that taxes capital gains (and there are many) counts it as part of the income tax. Ditto for the federal government. In response to a query by Washington state Rep. Dan Newhouse, the Internal Revenue Service wrote that ""capital gains are treated as income under the tax code and taxed as such."" In March 2022, Douglas County Superior Court Judge Brian Huber rejected the ""excise tax,"" declaring it ""unconstitutional and invalid."" Judge Huber was appointed by Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee. The state Supreme Court issued a stay of that decision, and the Department of Revenue is collecting the tax as it awaits the court's decision. At oral argument on Thursday, the Justices probed the excise tax point, but they noted that excise taxes are transactions and states can't tax such transactions across state lines under the U.S. Constitution.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

He's selling it as a 25% ""minimum tax"" on billionaire incomes, but see the fine print . The tax would apply to ""those with wealth of more than $100 million,"" while covering ""all of their income, including appreciated assets."" Slight problem: Appreciated assets are not income. The Constitution bans the federal government from imposing ""direct taxes,"" unless they are apportioned among the states according to population.

That question can be trickier than it sounds, since the IRS says income includes fringe benefits, plus ""the fair market value of property or services you receive in bartering."" Yet it's relatively easier to say what income isn't. If you own a house, or a stock, or a trendy and pricey modernist painting, it isn't income simply when the market value rises. In a notable 1920 case, the Supreme Court considered a stockholder who received additional shares as a dividend. ""We are brought irresistibly to the conclusion,"" said the majority in Eisner v. Macomber, ""that neither under the Sixteenth Amendment nor otherwise has Congress power to tax without apportionment a true stock dividend made lawfully and in good faith, or the accumulated profits behind it, as income of the stockholder.""	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

The accompanying description mocks ""former Goldman Sachs executive Leon Cooperman,"" who ""was brought to tears on live television"" by the prospect of President Warren. Mug buyers are jokingly directed to ""savor a warm, slightly salty beverage"" as they ""contemplate all the good a wealth tax could do."" A new video ad from Ms. Warren goes further and personally names and shames Mr. Cooperman, as well as Joe Ricketts, the founder of TD Ameritrade; former Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein; and tech investor Peter Thiel.

It brings to mind FDR's attacks on Samuel Insull, the utility magnate whose company once supplied power to millions of Americans. In the early years of the Great Depression, the overleveraged business collapsed. Though later acquitted in three different trials, Insull was a convenient scapegoat for a rising politician looking to assign blame. During the 1932 election, Roosevelt assailed ""the great Insull monstrosity."" He boasted that the utility barons saw their opponent FDR as ""a dangerous man.""

These people haven't merely been successful, they've ""sucked out"" profits in a ""rigged system,"" or they've put the economy in a ""stranglehold."" Voting correctly or espousing the right views on social justice won't be protection. Mr. Blankfein is a Democrat who backed Hillary Clinton. Mr. Cooperman seems open to a ""Buffett rule"" for a high minimum tax, and he doesn't mind paying 50% of his income in combined taxes. None of this matters.

Less than half a year into the Biden Presidency, the Internal Revenue Service is already at the center of an abuse-of-power scandal. That news broke Tuesday when ProPublica, a website whose journalism promotes progressive causes, published information from what it said are 15 years of the tax returns of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and other rich Americans. Leaking such information is a crime, since under federal law tax returns are confidential. ProPublica says it received the files from ""an anonymous source"" and doesn't know who provided them, how they were obtained, or what the source's motives are.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

The story arrives amid the Biden Administration's effort to pass the largest tax increase as a share of the economy since 1968. The main Democratic argument for a tax hike is that the rich should pay their ""fair share."" The ProPublica story is a long argument that somehow the rich don't pay enough. The timing here is no coincidence, comrade. Someone at the IRS—or someone who hacked the IRS—leaked the documents to influence the debate in Congress. And right on time, Ron Wyden, the Senate's chief tax writer, opened a Finance Committee hearing Tuesday by mentioning the ProPublica data dump.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

""I'll have a proposal to change that."" You can bet he will. Yet the striking fact of the initial ProPublica story—it says the disclosures will continue for months—is how undramatic the findings are. It turns out that billionaires are very good at reducing their taxable income. Who knew? Investors and entrepreneurs like Messrs. Buffett and Bezos make most of their money from the appreciation in the value of their assets. Most of Mr. Bezos's wealth comes from the rising value of his stock in Amazon, which he founded. Mr. Buffett has long admitted he pays a relatively low income-tax rate because his wealth is based in the value of his company, Berkshire Hathaway.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

As these columns keep pointing out, the rich can afford to hire lawyers and accountants to exploit every part of the tax code to pay the minimum amount of income tax the law allows. ProPublica knows this, so its story tries to invent a scandal by calculating what it calls the ""true tax rate"" these fellows are paying. This is a phony construct that exists nowhere in the law and compares how much the ""wealth"" of these individuals increased from 2014 to 2018 compared to how much income tax they paid.

ProPublica makes much of the fact that these billionaires pay a lower rate on capital gains and dividends than they do on income. The story suggests this is unfair, but it isn't. The preferential rate for capital gains and dividends has been a central part of the tax code for decades, and for good reasons. Congress has wanted to encourage capital investment; assets are often held for decades and gains are only realized upon their sale; gains can't be adjusted for inflation over the years they are held; and investors can't deduct net capital losses from income beyond $3,000 a year. Bipartisan majorities have long supported this part of the tax code.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders ran for President calling for a new tax on wealth. The ProPublica story essentially argues for the Warren-Sanders agenda. We'll leave the case against such a tax for another day, but the political point is that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders lost. Mr. Biden didn't run on a wealth tax. This still leaves the real scandal, which is that someone leaked confidential IRS information about individuals to serve a political agenda.

As part of this effort, Mr. Biden wants the IRS to collect ""gross inflows and outflows on all business and personal accounts from financial institutions."" Why? So the information can be leaked to ProPublica? The IRS says it has begun an investigation into the tax-return disclosure, and by all means send the guilty to prison.

It proposes a 25% minimum tax on the ""full income"" of Americans with more than $100 million in wealth, by which it means taxing the increase in the value of assets even if no income is realized. •Personal income and c apital gains tax hikes. Mr. Biden wants to tax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary wage income for those making more than $1 million. This would effectively double the current 20% tax rate on capital gains since he also wants to raise the top rate on personal income over $400,000 to 39.6% from 37%.

The budget extends the 3.8% surtax currently applied on investment income of couples making more than $250,000 to business income. It also raises this rate and the top Medicare payroll tax on wages to 5% for those earning more than $400,000. This 44.6% top marginal rate would hit business, investment and wage income. Add state taxes, and many high earners would pay a combined top rate of more than 55%. This is higher than in the U.K. (45%), Germany (47.5%), Spain (54%) and even Sweden (52.3%).

Even liberal economists agree there are diminishing returns on capital-gains taxes once the rate exceeds 28%. Mr. Biden's tax increase could reduce revenue for the Treasury. •Corporate rate increases. The budget raises the corporate income rate to 28% from 21%, and the minimum rate on the foreign earnings of U.S. multinationals to 21% from 10.5%. This comes on top of the IRA's new 15% minimum tax on book income of corporations with more than $1 billion profit. Last year corporations started having to amortize their research and developing expenses over five years instead of deducting them immediately.

Add the average state corporate rate of 6%, and U.S. companies will be at a large global disadvantage. •4% stock buyback tax.

All of these tax increases are projected to raise revenue as a share of GDP to a new higher level of 20.1% of GDP in 2033, which is far above the 50-year average of 17.4%.

We should presumptively get rid of billionaires. All of them.” Mr. Scocca — a longtime writer at Gawker until that site was muffled by a billionaire — offered a straightforward argument for kneecapping the wealthiest among us.

Abolishing billionaires might not sound like a practical idea, but if you think about it as a long-term goal in light of today’s deepest economic ills, it feels anything but radical.

It could mean preventing people from keeping more than a billion in booty, but more likely it would mean higher marginal taxes on income, wealth and estates for billionaires and people on the way to becoming billionaires. These policy ideas turn out to poll very well , even if they’re probably not actually redistributive enough to turn most billionaires into sub-billionaires. More important, aiming to abolish billionaires would involve reshaping the structure of the digital economy so that it produces a more equitable ratio of superrich to the rest of us. Inequality is the defining economic condition of the tech age. Software, by its very nature, drives concentrations of wealth. Through network effects, in which the very popularity of a service ensures that it keeps getting more popular, and unprecedented economies of scale — in which Amazon can make Alexa once and have it work everywhere, for everyone — tech instills a winner-take-all dynamic across much of the economy.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Artificial intelligence is creating prosperous new industries that don’t employ very many workers ; left unchecked, technology is creating a world where a few billionaires control an unprecedented share of global wealth. But abolishment does not involve only economic policy. It might also take the form of social and political opprobrium.

Last week, to dig into this question of whether it was possible to be a good billionaire, I called up two experts. The first was Peter Singer, the Princeton moral philosopher who has written extensively about the ethical duties of the rich . Mr. Singer told me that in general, he did not think it was possible to live morally as a billionaire, though he made a few exceptions: Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett, who have pledged to give away the bulk of their wealth to philanthropy, would not earn Mr. Singer’s scorn.	7	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Then there is the additional complication of whether even the ones who are “doing good” are actually doing good.

Which brings me to my second expert on the subject, Tom Steyer, the former hedge-fund investor who is devoting his billion-dollar fortune to a passel of progressive causes, like voter registration and climate change and impeaching Donald Trump. Mr. Steyer ticks every liberal box. He favors a wealth tax , and he and his wife have signed the Giving Pledge . He doesn’t live excessively lavishly — he drives a Chevy Volt. Still, I wondered when I got on the phone with him last week: Wouldn’t we be better off if we didn’t have to worry about rich people like him trying to alter the political process?	9	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

At one point I compared his giving with that of the Koch brothers, and he seemed genuinely pained by the comparison. “I understand about the real issues of money in politics,” he said. “We have a system that I know is not right, but it’s the one we got, and we’re trying as hard as possible to change it.” I admire his zeal. But if we tolerate the supposedly “good” billionaires in politics, we inevitably leave open the door for the bad ones. And the bad ones will overrun us. When American capitalism sends us its billionaires, it’s not sending its best. It’s sending us people who have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with them. They’re bringing inequality. They’re bringing injustice. They’re buying politicians.	10	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Uh-oh.	txt-opeds/2213537483.xml.txt	Elizabeth Warren doesn't appear to be capturing the imagination of American voters, but her policy proposals are a guide to where Democrats are heading if they win the White House in 2020. So check out her new plan to cancel some $640 billion in student loans, which Democrats once promised would be a money maker for government. Ms. Warren proposed this week to erase a substantial portion of more than $1.5 trillion in student debt held by Americans. Her plan would cancel up to $50,000 of student debt for every person with household income under $100,000. The loan forgiveness amount phases out as income rises. No one who earns more than $250,000 would qualify, though the forgiveness would extend to plenty of upper middle-class earners who have the means to repay.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

""For most Americans,"" she wrote in a post on Medium, ""cancellation will take place automatically using data already available to the federal government about income and outstanding student loan debt."" Click, delete. The irony is that when Democrats nationalized the student loan market in 2010, they swore it'd be a profit center for government and devoted ""savings"" to finance the Affordable Care Act. Part of the pitch was that the government could save on administrative costs. This was always a trick. The Obama Administration would claim profits from interest-rate arbitrage—borrowing at lower rates and charging more to students—even though a sizable portion of loans aren't in repayment.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

File that one as: Vindication is overrated. The Obama crowd also expanded income-based repayment options that capped payments and forgave the balance after 20 years (10 if you work in vaguely defined ""public service"").

The total cost once Ms. Warren throws in free college tuition for all: $1.25 trillion over 10 years, which is surely a conservative estimate. Ms. Warren says she'll pay for this with her ""ultra-millionaire"" wealth tax, which is also how she'll pay for her new universal child-care program, and probably everything else she proposes. This is only possible on the fantasy that her wealth tax raises $2.75 trillion over a decade. The wealth tax is a compliance nightmare and the wealthy will find ways to elude it or shift assets, which will lower government revenues. Higher taxes would have to reach down to the middle class and no doubt hit those who, say, choose to pursue a trade or work two jobs to graduate without debt. The Warren proposal is a recipe for class resentment and a subsidy for children who attend college at the expense of those who don't.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Ms. Warren laments that in her day college was much cheaper, yet the prime reason it's more expensive is federal subsidies and student loans. For every new dollar a college receives in subsidized loans, colleges raise tuition 60 cents, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This may be especially true at expensive schools that aren't all that selective, but tend to saddle students with debt and degrees that have a dubious return-on-investment. Remarkably, college has become more expensive even as students appear to be studying and learning less. A degree is often little more than a signal to employers that a person has some basic skills. But colleges suffer nothing if their students default on loans, and Ms. Warren's ""free"" college plan merely means more wealth transfers to her former well-to-do employers in academia.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

The clash among protesters, autonomous drones and police officers at the March for American Dreams this past weekend should be a call to action for policymakers. Skeptics in the White House and Congress should accept the consensus among economists and technologists that artificial intelligence and robotics are reshaping our economy, rendering most Americans’ jobs precarious.

Almost three in 10 adults of prime working age are not participating in the labor force at all and, therefore, are not counted in unemployment statistics. The answer obviously isn’t to shut down technological progress.

During the Industrial Revolution, machines displaced many artisans and agricultural workers. To deter these unemployed workers from seeking public relief, local governments set up poorhouses that required residents to perform hard labor. And between 1990 and 2020, the federal government — and some state governments — repeatedly cut social program spending even as middle-class jobs disappeared as a result of outsourcing and automation.

A recent survey of A.I. researchers predicts that by 2075, there is a 90 percent chance that machines will outperform humans in most economically relevant tasks. Machines have freed humans from drudgery (garbage collection) and danger (logging). But machines have also reduced the need for human labor faster than new, decent-paying jobs are being created. Consider truckers who trained to be remote safety drivers for autonomous vehicles. Remote safety driving had once been touted as a secure new job for truckers who would otherwise be displaced by automation. Last year, truck manufacturers successfully lobbied the federal government to phase out the requirement that all autonomous trucks be supervised by remote safety drivers.

Families would continue to receive benefits, albeit at a decreasing amount, until their earned income reaches three times the poverty level. The program would be funded by increasing the marginal rates on the wealth tax and the estate tax as well as expanding the federal carbon tax. At the same time, social programs made redundant by this negative income tax would be cut or eliminated. The legislation to establish this negative income tax program, the Renew American Dreams Act, has been stalled in Congress since 2040.

As a result, the government in Beijing has expanded its Dibao social assistance program to help these displaced workers. We should also look to recent American history and remember that cynics once questioned whether Medicare for All would ever pass in Congress — yet it did in 2034. The United States finally adopted single-payer health care because of changes in political will and technology. By 2030, a majority of American workers had become contract workers or part-time employees and thus ineligible for employer-based insurance; as a result, a large percentage of the electorate mobilized to support Medicare for All. At the same time, new technology has reduced the cost of health care administration, medical diagnosis and treatment, making the program sustainable in the long run.	7	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Even when she soared to the lead nationally, a mid-October Quinnipiac survey revealed a clear gender gap.

It was an issue Sanders dodged by acknowledging he'd raise taxes on the middle class but without offering many specifics. Warren's supporters have asked ever since if there was also sexism in Sanders's relative immunity from scrutiny on his numbers. But as the ""I have a plan for that"" candidate, Warren felt obliged to respond by laying out her proposal's costs and savings in great detail.

In this editorial, we address the latter issue by discussing how best to tax the rich. The smartest approach is the one endorsed in 2018 by economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD): significant, broad-based taxes on capital gains, coupled with similarly efficient levies on transfers of wealth through gifts and inheritance.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently renewed her call for such a tax — ""to make the ultra-rich finally pay their fair share"" — after ProPublica reported, based on leaked tax-return data, that the 25 wealthiest individuals in the United States, ""pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars by which their fortunes grow each year."" ProPublica muddied a basic distinction, which, properly understood, actually fortifies the case against a wealth tax. The story likened on-paper asset price appreciation with actual cash income, then lamented that the two aren't taxed at the same rate. However, the income tax system never required people to pay taxes on the appreciation of their assets, until they sold them and ""realized"" capital gains.

That could set off a downward spiral in the markets, affecting people of more modest means.

Americans should be familiar with the issues from our existing equivalent to a wealth tax: state and local property taxes, which raised $547 billion in 2018, a surprising 10 percent of all federal, state and local revenue. The fairness and accuracy of property-value assessments is a perennial bone of contention.

This would require undoing not only some of the 2017 GOP tax cuts, but much previous tax policy as well, which has produced a top federal marginal tax rate on capital gains of 23.8 percent — far below the top rate on ordinary income, which is 37 percent. The Treasury Department has aptly summarized the effect of this differential: ""Preferential tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends disproportionately benefit high-income taxpayers and provide many high-income taxpayers with a lower tax rate than many low- and middle-income taxpayers."" The disparity ""also encourages economically wasteful efforts to convert labor income into capital income as a tax avoidance strategy.""

The big money is in changing rules that let wealthy people pass on securities that have increased in value to their heirs, without the latter having to pay taxes on the appreciation. President Biden's American Families Plan calls for reform of this so-called ""stepped-up basis"" loophole that would yield an estimated $322.5 billion over 10 years. After years of erosion, due largely to Republican-sponsored tax cuts, the U.S. estate tax barely exists. Only the amount of an estate exceeding $11.7 million (twice that for couples) is currently subject to the 40 percent rate; 4,100 estate tax returns were filed in 2020, down from more than 100,000 in 2001, according to the Tax Policy Center, as the charts below show: Mr. Biden has proposed no changes, a disappointing exception to his otherwise progressive approach to taxation. (Current law, passed by a GOP Congress and signed by then-President Donald Trump in 2018, expires after 2025, at which point the individual estate tax exemption would revert to between $5 million and $6 million.) Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) proposes slashing the exemption to $3.5 million and subjecting larger inheritances to progressively higher rates, up to a maximum of 65 percent on those larger than $1 billion.

The former is part of what the United States has always been about; the latter, more consistent with the aristocratic empire patriots ousted in 1776.

2019-04-04	The Washington Post (Online)	A ‘wealth tax’ presents a revenue estimation puzzle	txt-opeds/2202976702.xml.txt	Lawrence H. Summers is a professor at and past president of Harvard University. He was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to President Barack Obama from 2009 through 2010. Natasha Sarin is an assistant professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and an assistant professor of finance at the Wharton School. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently proposed a 2 percent ""wealth tax"" on those worth more than $50 million. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California at Berkeley, have played a major role in developing and validating this proposal. They estimate that the tax would raise $187 billion in 2019 (Warren's additional 1 percent ""billionaire surcharge"" brings their total revenue estimate to $212 billion). This represents a substantial sum and has been widely quoted in both academic and policy discussions of wealth taxation.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-04-04	The Washington Post (Online)	A ‘wealth tax’ presents a revenue estimation puzzle	txt-opeds/2202976702.xml.txt	Saez and Zucman are perhaps the world's leading experts on wealth statistics, but they have not previously been involved in tax-revenue estimation. One of us (Summers) has often been struck by how much his judgments regarding tax revenue based on published economic statistics have differed from those of professional revenue estimators. So it seemed a worthwhile exercise to estimate the proposed wealth tax revenue based on actual tax revenue data. We reasoned as follows: The existing estate tax is a wealth tax levied at the time of death. If 2 percent of wealthy families experience a death and intergenerational transfer (rather than a spousal transfer) each year, then the current 40 percent estate tax should roughly be the equivalent of a wealth tax of 40 percent multiplied by 2 percent — or a 0.8 percent wealth tax — assuming equivalent definitions of wealth and the same threshold for taxation. Since most wealth is held by fairly elderly people, and the mortality rate of 70-year-olds is above 2 percent, we suspect that 2 percent mortality is a conservative estimate. So the actual wealth-tax equivalent of the estate tax is likely greater than 0.8 percent.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-04-04	The Washington Post (Online)	A ‘wealth tax’ presents a revenue estimation puzzle	txt-opeds/2202976702.xml.txt	The IRS reports that for 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, the estate tax raised around $10 billion from estates over $50 million — and this included tax collected on the first $50 million of estate tax value, so it overestimates the conceptually appropriate figure. Therefore, if this is what the revenue yield would be from a 0.8 percent wealth tax, the implication is that a 2 percent wealth tax would raise a total of $25 billion. That's around one-eighth of the Saez and Zucman estimate. We recognize that the effective estate tax rate (defined as what estates over $50 million actually paid in taxes) is only 13.5 percent. This is primarily because of charitable contributions and bequests to surviving spouses. We imagine that under a wealth tax, the charitable transfers that now take place at death might take place during the lifetimes of the wealthy, through transfers to donor-advised-funds and the like. Our mortality probability is an estimate for households, so that already excludes inter-spousal bequests. But even being maximally optimistic about the wealth tax's revenue potential by assuming that the estate tax is equivalent to a 0.27 percent wealth tax (the 13.5 percent effective estate tax rate multiplied by 2 percent mortality), we still get a revenue estimate for wealth taxation of only about $75 billion, or approximately 40 percent of the Saez and Zucman estimate.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

As a matter of arithmetic, a great deal of the wealth that Saez and Zucman assume will be hit by their wealth tax is escaping the estate tax. It's plausible that people are more aggressive in their estate-tax planning than they might be with their wealth-tax planning; they might, for example, be more prepared to make gifts to charity after they die than they would during their lifetimes. And there are certainly ways in which those who are competently advised can move assets to their children while they are alive while avoiding gift and estate taxes and still maintaining substantial control.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

We suspect that to a great extent it reflects the myriad ways wealthy people avoid paying estate taxes that in some form will be applicable in any actually legislated wealth tax. These include questionable appraisals; valuation discounts for illiquidity and lack of control; establishment of trusts that enable division of assets among family members with substantial founder control; planning devices that give some income to charity while keeping the remainder for the donor and her beneficiaries; tax-advantaged lending schemes; and other complex devices known only to sophisticated investors. Except for reducing a naive calculation by 15 percent, Saez and Zucman do not seem to take account of these devices.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

In response to this, advocates might insist on purity and not permit the wealth tax to be gamed as taxes typically are. Possibly. Experience suggests, however, that over time special benefits are almost always introduced into tax systems. No previous U.S. tax has existed in anything like this wealth tax's aspirational pure form. And comprehensive wealth-tax collection has not been accomplished in even the most egalitarian European societies — which have moved away in droves from far less ambitious wealth taxes. Such a push in the United States would involve forcing the sale of many family-owned businesses and require vast audit resources at a time when the IRS is unable to audit even 10 percent of millionaires. And it will involve placing limits on the ability to be charitable or to establish trusts for the benefits of grandchildren.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

But it is likely extremely premature to bank on anything like the $200 billion plus that Saez and Zucman estimate. And to be clear, this reality, while important in evaluating the wealth tax, is certainly not dispositive as to its merits, which we are sure will be the subject of continuing debate. There is, however, an important, more general point here. Common-sense revenue estimates by economists who are not very deeply steeped in revenue estimation tend to be overly optimistic.

He did a version of the following calculation (adjusted to match recent data): U.S. private equity firms have approximately $3 trillion in assets under management. Rates of return for the industry average around 8 percent, 20 percent of which typically flow to general partners as carried interest, taxed at the capital gains rate (23.8 percent) rather than the income-tax rate (now 37 percent for top earners). Using these numbers, taxing carried interest as ordinary income this year should generate $6.3 billion. The Congressional Budget Office reports revenue estimates that are less than one-fourth this.

A new study by a team of IRS analysts and academic economists, however, tells us that things are much worse than anyone suspected. The 1% conceal as much as 21% of their income from tax collectors, the study estimates. Of the unreported income, about 6 percentage points is hidden by “sophisticated evasion that goes undetected in random audits.” The unreported income for the 1%, households with more than about $420,000 in annual income, is as much as one-third higher than previously estimated, the authors wrote.

These are businesses that aren’t subject to the corporate income tax, but pass their income on to their owners to report on personal tax returns. The businesses are seldom audited. Consequently, as much as 28% of such income is underreported, the authors estimate. The top 1% are able to use stratagems unavailable to other taxpayers.

But in 1929, according to historian William E. Leuchtenburg, 36,000 families the top 0.1% of that era received as much income as the bottom 12 million households, or 42%.)	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Those crises led to two congressional investigations early in the last century, in which lawmakers tried to hold the millionaire nabobs of those eras responsible. In the first, Democratic Rep. Arsne Pujo of Louisiana put the Wall Street ""money trust"" on trial in 1912-1913, when the market crash of 1907 was still fresh in Americans' memories. Pujo's chief quarry was J.

Can anyone really dispute that the level of wealth held by the richest Americans today has reached absurd levels? The wealthiest individual in America, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, is worth $114 billion, according to the 2019 Forbes ranking of the 400 richest Americans. This is a sum that defeats efforts at human comprehension, but let's try. If Bezos spent $100 million a year on himself, it would take him 1,140 years to spend it all. Saez and Zucman calculated what would happen to the Bezos fortune if it had been subject to a 3% annual wealth tax applied to the excess over $1 billion since 1982. It would now be worth $86.8 billion, meaning that his $100-million annual spending would exhaust his nest egg in a mere 868 years.

Some contend that heavy taxation on the income or assets of the affluent will sap them of a willingness to work, depriving the economy of their energy and intellect.

2021-07-21	The Washington Post (Online)	Here’s the smart way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2553634022.xml.txt	Shrinking the wealth gap calls for a two-pronged attack: offer more opportunity to those at the bottom and trim the undue advantages of those at the top. In this editorial, we address the latter issue by discussing how best to tax the rich. The smartest approach is the one endorsed in 2018 by economists at the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD): significant, broad-based taxes on capital gains, coupled with similarly efficient levies on transfers of wealth through gifts and inheritance. As the OECD report concluded, this promises the greatest increase in equity with the fewest costly side effects.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-07-21	The Washington Post (Online)	Here’s the smart way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2553634022.xml.txt	This would not be the direct tax on wealth favored by many progressives. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently renewed her call for such a tax — ""to make the ultra-rich finally pay their fair share"" — after ProPublica reported, based on leaked tax-return data, that the 25 wealthiest individuals in the United States, ""pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars by which their fortunes grow each year."" ProPublica muddied a basic distinction, which, properly understood, actually fortifies the case against a wealth tax. The story likened on-paper asset price appreciation with actual cash income, then lamented that the two aren't taxed at the same rate. However, the income tax system never required people to pay taxes on the appreciation of their assets, until they sold them and ""realized"" capital gains. For good reason: ProPublica's logic implies that, when the stock market goes down, Elon Musk, whose billions are tied up in shares of Tesla, should get a tax cut.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE
2021-07-21	The Washington Post (Online)	Here’s the smart way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2553634022.xml.txt	In Ms. Warren's version of the wealth tax, which calls for 2 percent annual levies on net wealth above $50 million, and 3 percent above $1 billion, very rich people would face large tax bills even when they had little or negative net income, forcing them to sell assets to pay their taxes. That could set off a downward spiral in the markets, affecting people of more modest means. Though prices of marketable securities are easy to track, the huge chunks of private wealth tied up in real estate, rare art and closely held businesses are more difficult — sometimes impossible — to assess consistently.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

Americans should be familiar with the issues from our existing equivalent to a wealth tax: state and local property taxes, which raised $547 billion in 2018, a surprising 10 percent of all federal, state and local revenue. The fairness and accuracy of property-value assessments is a perennial bone of contention. Reforming local property taxes — though a difficult battle that would have to be waged across thousands of counties and cities — could go a long way toward reducing national wealth inequality, without adding a new layer of political controversy and policy complexity by trying to replicate them at the federal level.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

This would require undoing not only some of the 2017 GOP tax cuts, but much previous tax policy as well, which has produced a top federal marginal tax rate on capital gains of 23.8 percent — far below the top rate on ordinary income, which is 37 percent. The Treasury Department has aptly summarized the effect of this differential: ""Preferential tax rates on long-term capital gains and qualified dividends disproportionately benefit high-income taxpayers and provide many high-income taxpayers with a lower tax rate than many low- and middle-income taxpayers."" The disparity ""also encourages economically wasteful efforts to convert labor income into capital income as a tax avoidance strategy."" A notorious example of the latter is the ""carried interest"" loophole that enables hedge fund managers to characterize their multimillion-dollar annual compensation as lightly taxed capital gains.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2021-07-21	The Washington Post (Online)	Here’s the smart way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2553634022.xml.txt	The higher capital gains rate should be applied to a broader base of investment income, of which carried interest, egregious as it is, represents a relatively small slice. The big money is in changing rules that let wealthy people pass on securities that have increased in value to their heirs, without the latter having to pay taxes on the appreciation. President Biden's American Families Plan calls for reform of this so-called ""stepped-up basis"" loophole that would yield an estimated $322.5 billion over 10 years. After years of erosion, due largely to Republican-sponsored tax cuts, the U.S. estate tax barely exists. Only estates totaling more than $11.7 million are currently liable for the nominal 40 percent levy; 4,100 estate tax returns were filed in 2020, down from more than 100,000 in 2001, according to the Tax Policy Center, as the charts below show: Mr. Biden has proposed no changes, a disappointing exception to his otherwise progressive approach to taxation. (Current law, passed by a GOP Congress and signed by then-President Donald Trump in 2018, expires after 2025, at which point the estate tax exemption would revert to between $5 million and $6 million.) Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) proposes slashing the exemption to $3.5 million and subjecting larger inheritances to progressively higher rates, up to a maximum of 65 percent on those larger than $1 billion. Yet there is plenty of revenue to be raised without going that far.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-07-21	The Washington Post (Online)	Here’s the smart way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2553634022.xml.txt	A Brookings Institution analysis of several alternative approaches showed that simply reverting to estate tax rules in place as recently as 2004 could yield $98 billion per year, far more than the $16 billion the government raised in 2020. If the inheritance tax were more substantial people could still aspire to bestow a legacy on their children, but without unduly perpetuating unearned privilege. The former is part of what the United States has always been about; the latter, more consistent with the aristocratic empire patriots ousted in 1776. The public sector could use new revenue from stiffer capital gains and estate taxes to expand opportunity for those who were not born into wealth. How best to do that is the subject of our next editorial.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Which is to say, when an ordinary person hears that some change to the tax code would raise $3 billion over 10 years, that sounds like a huge amount. But at the moment, the federal government spends more than $4 trillion a year — more than $40 trillion over the course of a decade. In context, $3 billion isn't even a rounding error. It would take hundreds of such changes to make a noticeable dent in our debt or deficit. Meanwhile, looking through the other end of the Washington kaleidoscope makes staggering sums seem rather dainty to the unpracticed eye. Take, for example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren's proposed wealth taxes. In their current iteration, the Massachusetts Democrat's plans would have the government take 2 percent of all wealth above $50 million, and 6 percent of all wealth over $1 billion.

But of course, six cents on every dollar taken out every year would  be an enormous chunk of their wealth. Estimates from two of the economists who advised Warren on her wealth tax found that if the tax had gone into effect in 1982, famous billionaires such as Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg and Warren Buffett would have lost most of their fortunes by now.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

There's a 14.8 percent Social Security tax on net investment income for everyone making more than $250,000 a year ($400,000 for a married couple). Plus the top 1 percent of households would have to pay capital gains taxes every year, at the same rate as their wage and salary income, instead of paying a reduced rate when they sold the asset. If we run those numbers for someone worth $10 billion, and earning the 8 percent historical average return for an S&P 500 index fund, we find that our hypothetical billionaire would have made about $800 million over the course of the year. They would then owe a wealth tax of roughly $600 million. But they would also have to pay taxes on their unrealized capital gains, and since those gains would be taxed as regular income, that means they'd owe about $300 million. On top of that, they'd have to make that Social Security contribution, which would add another $120 million in taxes. All in all, they'd end the year about $200 million poorer than they started.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

And perhaps that's the whole point of the tax. But if so, you cannot then claim, as Warren does, that you'll use this tax to fund significant new spending. In our hypothetical example, after five years of perfectly steady 8 percent returns, the billionaire tax base would have declined by 10 percent. No important program should depend on a revenue source that is — by design — going to shrink so quickly. Nor is that the only area where funding problems would arise. Such high capital gains taxes would effectively bar wealthy Americans from buying U.S. Treasury debt, which is yielding between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent, far too little to keep them even with the tax man. The abrupt and simultaneous exit of all the nation's rich people from the Treasury market would mean at least one of two things: Either interest rates would have to rise to entice them back, or we'd become even more dependent on foreign money to fund government operations.

Because the pre-Trump world — in which voting rights were being gutted and 40 percent of Americans couldn’t afford a $400 emergency bill — is no kind of place to go back to. Mr. Biden himself seemed to concede this point by tempering his restoration message with the slogan “Build Back Better.” On Election Day eve, I spoke with Senator Chuck Schumer of New York — the minority leader, who could, by a razor’s edge, become the majority leader in 2021 if the results of two presumptive runoffs for Senate seats in Georgia go the Democrats’ way. Because, like Mr. Biden, Mr. Schumer is an institutionalist and a moderate, I asked him about this idea of restoration versus transformation. Almost as soon as he heard me say the word “normalcy,” he began, for lack of a better term, to filibuster: “No, no, I don’t buy that.”	2	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

These are problems that snicker at incrementalism. In one favorable scenario, come January, two Democratic runoff victories in Georgia leave a President Biden facing a 50-50 Senate, with his vice president, Kamala Harris, possessing the crucial tiebreaking vote. Even then, the scope of available policy reforms would still be substantially limited unless Mr. Biden sought to eliminate the filibuster that requires 60 Senate votes to get major legislation enacted. Doing away with this rule would, of course, immediately doom any chance of a constructive working relationship with Republicans.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

If Democrats win the two presumed Georgia runoffs, Senate Democrats will represent roughly 41 million more people than the Republican half of the chamber.

The most immediate problem is the plague. Mr. Trump was so inept at containing it that he couldn’t even keep it from infecting him. But the sanity and science-based competence that Mr. Biden has promised will go only so far.

And the evictions now surging are coming in the wake of a housing market that has long been unaffordable. Even if high unemployment were reversed, it would hardly repair our increasingly classist and Uber-ized labor market. And if Democrats do win the Senate? Senator Schumer told me he envisions a first 100 days filled with a raft of measures on the virus and economic relief, mixed in with policies that address inequality, climate change, student debt, immigration and more.

First, Mr. Biden’s own instinct toward caution — which can easily end up enabling paralysis at a time when Democrats’ window for proving the promise of an active government could be closing. Any measure of success is likely to be determined by how seriously a Biden administration takes the inevitable calls for fiscal conservatism and austerity (despite historically low interest rates).

In certain areas, such as climate change and student debt, he has shown a willingness to have his initial policy view revised by others.

The often-intense debates about these policies aren't just important because they could reshape the U.S. economy. They also reflect a larger, more fundamental disagreement about capitalism itself. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) believe that the American system of extractive capitalism is fundamentally broken — Sanders to the point of identifying as a democratic socialist — and see its failure as one of the forces that carried President Trump to the White House. Former vice president Joe Biden voices an opposing view: At an October fundraiser in Silicon Valley, he characterized Trump not as a product of American capitalism but rather a threat to it. ""You don't need some radical, radical socialist kind of answer to any of this — you've just got to make capitalism work like it's supposed to work,"" he said.

Brooks and New York Times columnist David Brooks. I argued that the American system is broken in three ways. First, it is fueling extreme inequality. Four decades of stagnant wages and upward flows of wealth in the United States have supercharged the existing wealth divide and other inequalities rooted in racial, gender and geographic differences. Productivity gains have flowed to the investor class, not to workers, and social mobility has declined. In his latest column (prepared for the debate), David Brooks countered that ""capitalism has brought about the greatest reduction of poverty in human history."" But Oxfam International highlights a more nuanced reality: While there has been a meaningful decline in extreme poverty, hundreds of millions more people could have been lifted out of poverty if not for extreme inequalities within and across countries.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

In the Citizens United era, the amount of money in politics has exploded, resulting in elected officials from both parties who are more beholden to wealthy donors — and their business interests — than ever before. Corporate concentration is reducing competition and rendering both workers and consumers increasingly powerless against rising plutocracy. And this is happening as the forces of private equity and big tech conspire to annihilate the local and independent journalism that is vital to maintaining a democratic society. It doesn't take a socialist to see capitalism's corrosive impact on democracy. In fact, South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a former McKinsey consultant who was forced on Monday to finally agree to disclose his campaign bundlers, used to recognize it earlier in the campaign, saying, ""There's tension between capitalism and democracy, and negotiating that tension is probably the biggest challenge for America right now.""	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

As corporate lobbyists work to dismantle the regulatory apparatus, the companies they represent are irrevocably harming our environment, our health and our collective future. In pursuit of profits at any cost, corporations continue to ravage public lands, demolishing ecosystems, and poisoning the water we drink and the air we breathe. Meanwhile, even as corporate America has become more vocal about the importance of sustainability and the perils of climate change, it has opposed the dramatic policy changes needed to prevent catastrophe. American politics is finally having a long-overdue debate about how to respond to these trends. Many of the ideas being discussed in the presidential race are undoubtedly part of the solution. But tweaking around the economy's edges won't be enough. We need a deep, structural redesign of basic institutions and functions; we need a new system to better serve the common good.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

And there will be a ""plutocracy prevention"" program — not to be punitive, but to ensure that billionaires pay more in taxes than teachers and nurses, and that we have the revenue needed to rebuild decaying infrastructure, combat climate change, reverse declining social mobility and more. Brooks writes that one of capitalism's strengths is ""creating a learning process to help people figure stuff out."" On that we agree. But I've learned over four decades of observing and writing about the economy that capitalism as we've known it doesn't work. Time is of the essence.

2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	How not to repeat the mistakes of 2011. In a couple of days I’m going to be participating in an Economic Policy Institute conference on “excessive wealth disorder” — the problems and dangers created by extreme concentration of income and wealth at the top. I’ve been asked to give a short talk at the beginning of the conference, focusing on the political and policy distortions high inequality creates, and I’ve been trying to put my thoughts in order. So I thought I might as well write up those thoughts for broader dissemination. While popular discourse has concentrated on the “1 percent,” what’s really at issue here is the role of the 0.1 percent, or maybe the 0.01 percent — the truly wealthy, not the “$400,000 a year working Wall Street stiff” memorably ridiculed in the movie Wall Street. This is a really tiny group of people, but one that exerts huge influence over policy.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	Where does this influence come from? People often talk about campaign contributions, but those are only one channel. In fact, I’d identify at least four ways in which the financial resources of the 0.1 percent distort policy priorities: 1. Raw corruption. We like to imagine that simple bribery of politicians isn’t an important factor in America, but it’s almost surely a much bigger deal than we like to think. 2. Soft corruption. What I mean by this are the various ways short of direct bribery politicians, government officials, and people with policy influence of any kind stand to gain financially by promoting policies that serve the interests or prejudices of the wealthy. This includes the revolving door between public service and private-sector employment, think-tank fellowships, fees on the lecture circuit, and so on.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	3. Campaign contributions. Yes, these matter. 4. Defining the agenda: Through a variety of channels — media ownership, think tanks, and the simple tendency to assume that being rich also means being wise — the 0.1 percent has an extraordinary ability to set the agenda for policy discussion, in ways that can be sharply at odds with both a reasonable assessment of priorities and public opinion more generally. Of these, I want to focus on item (4), not because it’s necessarily the most important — as I said, I suspect that raw corruption is a bigger deal than most of us can imagine — but because it’s something I think I know about. In particular, I want to focus on a particular example that for me and others was a kind of radicalizing moment, a demonstration that extreme wealth really has degraded the ability of our political system to deal with real problems.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	The example I have in mind was the extraordinary shift in conventional wisdom and policy priorities that took place in 2010-2011, away from placing priority on reducing the huge suffering still taking place in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, and toward action to avert the supposed risk of a debt crisis. This episode is receding into the past, but it was extraordinary and shocking at the time, and could all too easily be a precursor to politics in the near future. Let’s talk first about the underlying economic circumstances. At the beginning of 2011, the U.S. unemployment rate was still 9 percent, and long-term unemployment in particular was at extraordinary levels, with more than 6 million Americans having been out of work for 6 months or more. It was an ugly economic situation, but its causes were no mystery. The bursting of the housing bubble, and the subsequent attempts of households to reduce their debt, had let to a severe shortfall of aggregate demand. Despite very low interest rates by historical standards, businesses weren’t willing to invest enough to take up the slack created by this household pullback.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	Textbook economics offered very clear advice about what to do under these circumstances. This was exactly the kind of situation in which deficit spending helps the economy, by supplying the demand the private sector wasn’t. Unfortunately, the support provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act — the Obama stimulus, which was inadequate but had at least cushioned the effects of the slump — peaked in mid-2010 and was in the process of falling off sharply. So the obvious, Economics 101 move would have been to implement another significant round of stimulus. After all, the federal government was still able to borrow long-term at near-zero real interest rates.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	Somehow, however, over the course of 2010 a consensus emerged in the political and media worlds that in the face of 9 percent unemployment the two most important issues were … deficit reduction and “entitlement reform,” i.e. cuts in Social Security and Medicare. And I do mean consensus. As Ezra Klein noted, “the rules of reportorial neutrality don’t apply when it comes to the deficit.” He cited, for example, Mike Allen asking Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles “whether they believed Obama would do ‘the right thing’ on entitlements — with ‘the right thing’ clearly meaning ‘cut entitlements.’” So where did this consensus come from? To be fair, the general public has never bought into Keynesian economics; as far as I know, most voters, if asked, will always say that the budget deficit should be reduced. In November 1936, just after FDR’s reelection, Gallup asked voters whether the new administration should balance the budget; 65 percent said yes, only 28 percent no.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	But voters tend to place a relatively low priority on deficits as compared with jobs and the economy. And they overwhelmingly favor spending more on health care and Social Security. The rich, however, are different from you and me. In 2011 the political scientists Benjamin Page, Larry Bartels, and Jason Seawright managed to survey a group of wealthy individuals in the Chicago area. They found striking differences between this group’s policy priorities and those of the public at large. Budget deficits topped the list of problems they considered “very important,” with a third considering them the “most important” problem. While the respondents also expressed concern about unemployment and education, “they ranked a distant second and third among the concerns of wealthy Americans.”	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

By large margins, voters at large wanted to expand spending on health care and Social Security. By almost equally large margins, the wealthy wanted to reduce spending on those same programs. So what was the origin of the conventional-wisdom consensus that emerged in 2010-2011 — a consensus so overwhelming that leading journalists abandoned the conventions of reportorial neutrality, and described austerity policies as the self-evident “right thing” for politicians to be doing? What happened, essentially, was that the political and media establishment internalized the preferences of the extremely wealthy.	7	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	Now, 2011 was an especially dramatic example of how this happens, but it wasn’t unique. In their recent book “Billionaires and Stealth Politics,” Page, Seawright, and Matthew Lacombe point out the enduring effects of plutocratic political influence on the Social Security debate: “Despite the strong support among most Americans for protecting and expanding Social Security benefits, for example, the intense, decades-long campaign to cut or privatize Social Security that was led by billionaire Pete Peterson and his wealthy allies appears to have played a part in thwarting any possibility of expanding Social Security benefits. Instead, the United States has repeatedly come close (even under Democratic Presidents Clinton and Obama) to actually cutting benefits as part of a bipartisan ‘grand bargain’ concerning the federal budget.”	8	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	And here’s the thing: While we don’t want to romanticize the wisdom of the common man, there’s absolutely no reason to believe that the policy preferences of the wealthy are based on any superior understanding of how the world works. On the contrary, the wealthy were obsessed with debt and uninterested in mass unemployment at a time when deficits weren’t a problem — were, indeed, part of the solution — while unemployment was. And the widespread belief among the wealthy that we should raise the retirement age is based, literally, on failure to understand how the other half lives (or, actually, doesn’t). Yes, life expectancy at age 65 has gone up, but overwhelmingly for the upper part of the income distribution. Less affluent Americans, who are precisely the people who depend most on Social Security, have seen little rise in life expectancy, so there is no justification for forcing them to work longer.	9	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	Where do the preferences of the wealthy come from? You don’t have to be a vulgar Marxist to recognize a strong element of class interest. The push for austerity was clearly linked to a desire to shrink the tax-and-transfer state, which in all advanced countries, even America, is a significant force for redistribution away from the wealthy toward citizens with lower incomes. You can see the true goals of austerity a couple of ways. First, by comparison with other advanced countries the U.S. has low taxes and low social spending, yet almost all the energy of self-proclaimed deficit hawks was expended on demands for reduced spending rather than increased taxes. Second, it’s striking how much less deficit hysteria we’re hearing now than we did seven years ago. The full-employment budget deficit now is about as large, as a share of GDP, as it was in early 2012, when unemployment was still above 8 percent. But this deficit, although far less justified by macroeconomic considerations, was created by tax cuts — and somehow the deficit hawks are fairly quiet.	10	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-06-22	New York Times (Online)	Notes on Excessive Wealth Disorder	txt-opeds/2244758261.xml.txt	No doubt many wealthy backers of tax cuts for themselves and benefit cuts for others manage to convince themselves that this is in everyone’s interest. People are in general good at that sort of self-delusion. The fact remains that the wealthy, on average, push for policies that benefit themselves even when they often hurt the economy as a whole. And the sheer wealth of the wealthy is what empowers them to get a lot of what they want. So what does this imply going forward? First, in the near term, both during the 2020 election and after, it’s going to be really important to ride herd on both centrist politicians and the media, and not let them pull another 2011, treating the policy preferences of the 0.1 percent as the Right Thing as opposed to, well, what a certain small class of people want. There’s a fairly long list of things progressives have recently advocated that the usual suspects will try to convince everyone are crazy ideas nobody serious would support, e.g.	11	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

They are, in fact, backed by research from some of the world’s leading economic experts. Any journalist or centrist politician who treats them as self-evidently irresponsible is doing a 2011, internalizing the prejudices of the wealthy and treating them as if they were facts.	12	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Here’s why it won’t be easy.	txt-opeds/2174659300.xml.txt	Cory Booker is running for president, and he has a story to tell. Which actually distinguishes the New Jersey senator from some other Democrats who have already joined the 2020 race, and some others who probably will before long. Not only are there already eight major announced candidates, we've come so far that one candidate, former West Virginia state senator Richard Ojeda, who had already entered the race, decided his candidacy wasn't getting traction and dropped out. When I say Booker has a story to tell, what I mean is that his campaign has a theme, a point, an idea that he wants voters to understand and sign on to when they choose him instead of other candidates. Some candidates have one and some don't: If I asked you why Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is running for president you could probably tell me (the system is rigged against ordinary people and we need to break the power of the plutocrats), but if I asked you why Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) or Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) is running, you'd probably have a more difficult time.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-02-01	The Washington Post (Online)	Cory Booker is running for president. Here’s why it won’t be easy.	txt-opeds/2174659300.xml.txt	To focus on campaign themes may sound shallow or trite, but it's been central to campaigning as long as there has been campaigning. And every successful presidential candidate has fashioned that kind of story to tell the voters, one that explains what the problem in America is, what the solution is, and why they're the only one who can deliver it. Let's take a look at the video with which Booker launched his campaign this morning: So the story Booker is telling is that our country has been riven by political conflict and he can bring us together, whereupon we'll be able to solve our problems in a way that that allows all Americans to share in prosperity and progress. Or, as another candidate memorably once said: ""I'm a uniter, not a divider.""	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The fact is, this message is true to who he is and who he has always been. Booker can be as partisan as the next politician, but he has always presented himself as the kind of guy who will hug everybody and talk anybody into supporting him. My favorite scene in ""Street Fight,"" Marshall Curry's terrific 2005 documentary about Booker's first unsuccessful run for mayor of Newark, is the one where Booker meets with a group of Orthodox Jews and starts comfortably dropping Yiddish phrases into his pitch (Booker and the Jewish community go way back). He really does want to bring everyone together.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Bush told before him, and the same one Bill Clinton told before him. It's safe to say that the number of Americans who think we can transcend our differences to solve problems together is not particularly large. And it's especially small in the Democratic Party, where voters are looking for someone who will not only fight vigorously against President Trump but will do so in a way that makes a strong case for progressivism. Before I go any further, I should say that the best starting point when assessing any presidential candidate is to remember that we really don't know how they'll perform, or how appealing they'll be, until the campaign gets going. Running for president is unlike anything any of them have ever done, and history is full of candidates who seemed like strong contenders but turned out to be duds (John Glenn, Joe Biden), as well as candidates no one expected to be as strong as they were (Paul Tsongas, Howard Dean, Bernie Sanders).	3	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-02-01	The Washington Post (Online)	Cory Booker is running for president. Here’s why it won’t be easy.	txt-opeds/2174659300.xml.txt	Booker has strengths — tirelessness, youth and the fact that, as an African American, he at least has the possibility of doing well with the party's most important constituency, the base of the base. There's nothing sure there, however, not only because there's another African American candidate in the race, but also because there are plenty of African Americans who take issue with Booker's record. Which leads us to what may be his central challenge, which is that his ideological profile is . . . complicated. He takes some strongly progressive positions (supporting Medicare-for-all and the legalization of marijuana), but also has parts of his record in Newark and the Senate that will draw skeptical questions from voters. To highlight this, let's look at what former New Jersey governor Chris Christie said when asked about Booker at a recent Washington Post event: Talented, smart, articulate, hope that he stays in this campaign to the roots that I saw him establish in New Jersey. He was someone who was pro-voucher, he was pro-charter school, he was somebody who was tough on crime in the city of Newark. If he stays in that lane, and is the articulate, inspirational guy that he is, then I think he's got a legitimate chance to be a serious potential problem for the president in the general election. If he goes way wacky left, then he's just going to be another one of those people and he won't be able to distinguish himself. I like him. He's a friend. We've been friends for 15 years. He's a good person, and I like Cory Booker.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

He'll be questioned thoroughly on matters like charter schools, which are controversial among liberals, as well as his complicated relationship with Wall Street and pharmaceutical companies, which have a huge presence in his home state. When those questions are raised, Booker's people push back hard, listing proposals he has — such as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, which is anathema to the industry. They say, and he will too, that whether he took some contributions from big pharma hasn't affected the positions he takes or how he would treat them as president. But the mere fact that he gets praise from Republicans such as Christie will be enough to make many primary voters suspicious.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

As he falls in the polls, Mr. Sanders has to do something to reignite that 2016 fire. But the Vermont Senator's problem is that Ms. Warren has co-opted more or less all of his important policy proposals.

The situation is ripe for the sort of class conflict the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu used to describe: pitting those who are rich in cultural capital against those who are rich in financial capital. And into this fray wanders Thomas Piketty. His book “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” argues that the real driver of inequality is not primarily differences in human capital. It’s differences in financial capital. Inequality is not driven by young hip professionals who arm their kids with every advantage and get them into competitive colleges; it’s driven by hedge fund oligarchs.

He predicts that the return on capital will be high, though there could be diminishing returns as the supply increases. He predicts that family fortunes will concentrate, though big ones in the past have tended to dissipate and families like the Gateses give a lot away.

The problem with those who stress financial capital inequality over human capital inequality is that up until now they have described a big problem but they have no big proposal to address it.

Piketty proposes that all the governments in the world, or at least the big ones, get together, find all the major wealth in the world and then tax capital progressively. Piketty wouldn’t raise taxes on income, which thriving professionals have a lot of; he would tax investment capital, which they don’t have enough of.

Second, emphasize a contrasting agenda that will reward growth, saving and investment, not punish these things, the way Piketty would. Support progressive consumption taxes not a tax on capital.

He had excuses for both — in Ohio for a Human Rights Campaign event in Columbus for the former, and at a grandchild's high school graduation for the latter. His absence, however, was noticed. Last week, he also stumbled on the Hyde Amendment, finally joining the other Democratic candidates in advocating for its repeal. Does any of this matter? On one level, these issues are purely matter for media chatter. Most voters are not going to hold it against Biden that he used to be in favor of the Hyde Amendment; they care more about what his current position is and whether he seems sincere about it. (Indeed, the Morning Consult poll released Tuesday showed virtually no change in his support from last week.) Likewise, no one a few weeks from now, let alone months ago, will remember which events he attended. However, Biden and his team may want to consider six questions that may be the difference between winning the nomination or winding up as the Jeb Bush of the 2020 race.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-06-11	The Washington Post (Online)	Six questions for Team Biden	txt-opeds/2238410107.xml.txt	First, what if he's not the only electable Democrat? At least for now, polling shows that several Democrats could beat President Trump. For Democrats fixated on electability (a subjective, elusive concept) that may detract from the argument Democrats need Biden to beat Trump. Rather, Biden must figure out how to communicate that Democrats and the country as a whole needs Biden to govern. Second, why isn't he elevating foreign policy? The one arena in which few if any candidates can claim more experience over Biden is foreign policy. (One can question whether Biden has been correct more times than he's been wrong — e.g., the Iraq War — but he knows world leaders, understands how diplomacy functions and appreciates the stature that the president brings to international affairs. Frankly, the rest of the field has been shy about even discussing foreign policy, and Biden should make more of the gap in foreign-policy bona fides. Trump has ruined U.S. credibility, turned his back on human rights, emboldened illiberal regimes and lost influence in the Middle East. His China policy is a muddle and has yet to bear fruit. Who's going to right the ship? Biden needs to make the case it is him, and that foreign policy (from trade to climate change to China's theft of U.S. technology) directly affects Americans.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-06-11	The Washington Post (Online)	Six questions for Team Biden	txt-opeds/2238410107.xml.txt	Third, could Biden make his relationships with Republicans into an advantage? Biden annoys the left when he says he gets along with Republicans — or worse, likes some of them! Biden however has a powerful case that he knows how to unify Democrats and pick off enough Republicans to get the progressive agenda through Congress. What's President Bernie Sanders going to do when not even all the Democrats support Medicare-for-all? When Republicans block President Elizabeth Warren's wealth tax, how's she going to pay for all her creative plans? Biden needs to convey that it's one thing to give a campaign speech or to roll out a legislative wish list, but what most candidates are proposing won't survive contact with the real political universe. He's going to have to make the case that he has the secret sauce for luring Republicans into deals that deliver what progressives want.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Women are disproportionately Democratic, and African American women are the most loyal Democrats out there. Biden needs put his Hyde Amendment stumble in the rear-view mirror and gain an upper hand with critical female voters — no easy task with multiple female candidates. It might seem gimmicky to some, but he could flat-out promise to pick a female running mate and to make half his judicial and executive picks (including his Cabinet) women. Perhaps there is some daring policy plan others haven't figured out that can be used to gain female voters' support but, barring that, Biden would be wise to make the case that ""personnel is policy"" — and that half his administration would be made up of women.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-06-11	The Washington Post (Online)	Six questions for Team Biden	txt-opeds/2238410107.xml.txt	Fifth, how does he keep himself above the scrum of candidates (making Trump his primary focus) without seeming to take the nomination for granted? Biden needs to get out more, submit to interviews, go to town halls, keep a more vigorous schedule and show that he is hustling for every single vote. He can still focus on Trump, but the lackadaisical schedule needs to end. Warren stays at her events until the last autograph and selfie. Biden should be similarly dedicated to winning over voters person by person — at least in the early states. Sixth, is ""rebuilding the middle class"" too nebulous a campaign message? Biden is a union man, a defender of the middle class which he says built the country. However, Warren is talking about leveling the playing field; other candidates talk about the wealth gap between whites and blacks. Biden however could stand out from the crowd in promising to make everyone who wants to work able to compete in the 21st-century economy. Embrace automation and globalization as irreversible and then lay out the most detailed, effective scheme for educating and training the workforce for current and future job markets — not re-running the 1950′s. Biden can make an impression by promising to eliminate not just the income and wealth gap, but the skills, productivity and education gaps, as well.

Seattle was the first major U.S. city to adopt a $15 minimum wage and one of the first to require businesses to provide paid sick leave. The City Council achieved another first last week, when it unanimously enacted an ordinance requiring food-delivery app companies to provide gig workers ""premium pay"" for deliveries in the city, on top of their usual compensation, and prohibiting the companies from raising fees or leaving the city in response, even if the new rule causes them to lose money.

With thousands of homebound Seattle residents in need of grocery deliveries, the costs add up. The City Council expects the companies to eat it: The ordinance states that gig companies may not ""reduce or otherwise modify the areas in the City that are served,"" ""reduce a gig worker's compensation,"" or ""add customer charges to online orders for delivery of groceries"" in response to the new premium.

Yet the couple's constitutional challenge stands to slam shut the door on a federal wealth tax like the one Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants to enact. The story is complicated, though less so than the tax code. In the 1990s Mr. Moore, a software engineer, worked at Microsoft on its Office applications and grew close to a fellow programmer, Ravi Agrawal. Mr. Agrawal dreamed of returning to his native India to do something for the small-scale farmers he knew growing up in the state of Chhattisgarh. On a series of trips to India in the early 2000s, he saw an opportunity. Unlike the massive agricultural operations that feed the U.S., capital-poor farmers working a few acres each serve much of India. What struck Mr. Agrawal is that their tools were plainly inadequate, far less reliable and effective than what any American could buy for a few dollars at Home Depot. His idea was to close the gap by providing India's poorest farmers with tools that would improve their livelihoods and lives, even in the face of the labor shortages in many rural areas as workers migrated to the cities.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

He approached friends to invest in his new company, KisanKraft, and the Moores put up $40,000. It was a lot of money for them, but they believed in Mr. Agrawal and the mission. They knew they were unlikely to earn much of a financial return on their investment, because the plan was to reinvest any profits in the business and serve more of India's rural poor. That was the real return, and it proved massive. Mr. Agrawal had put his finger on an unmet need, and by 2017 KisanKraft had expanded to reach the entire country, with hundreds of employees, thousands of dealers and millions of customers. The Moores have never received a dime from their investment, yet it paid off beyond their greatest hope.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

As part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, Congress reworked the way multinational corporations are taxed, limiting the amount that they had to pay on foreign income. Offsetting part of the cost was a new, one-time tax on earnings that certain foreign corporations had accumulated over the preceding 30 years but not distributed to their shareholders through dividends. The law deemed those earnings as 2017 income to the shareholders and taxed them on it. The Moores' bill amounted to $15,000. They paid and are now suing for a refund, on grounds that the new tax is unconstitutional.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Article I requires that any ""direct tax""—one that falls directly on the payer rather than being passed on to someone else, such as the consumer—""be apportioned among the several states"" according to population. The idea was that taxation, like representation, should be fairly apportioned so that no state or region could be singled out for disadvantage. Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 36 that tax apportionment was a key component of federalism, given that direct taxes could disrupt local economies in ways federal lawmakers couldn't even imagine. By contrast, men of commerce would understand the effects of indirect taxes like tariffs or sales taxes, which the Constitution therefore didn't subject to apportionment, only uniformity.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

A challenge to a 2017 law could shut the door to Elizabeth Warren's far more ambitious levy.	txt-opeds/2568068877.xml.txt	The Supreme Court held the first income tax unconstitutional as an unapportioned direct tax in 1895, and Congress eventually responded by proposing the 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913. It authorizes Congress to tax ""incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment."" So far as tax law goes, the Moores' argument is straightforward. The new tax is a direct tax, and it isn't on income—after all, they haven't received any from KisanKraft. Instead, they're being taxed on their property, the KisanKraft shares. The tax is therefore constitutionally invalid because it isn't apportioned. The government insists that the Moores are being taxed on income, because KisanKraft could theoretically distribute its accumulated earnings in the future. The courts, however, have consistently defined ""income"" to require, as the Supreme Court put it in Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass (1955), ""undeniable accessions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion."" As the Moores observe, they haven't realized a dime in income. The government argues that the courts should abandon the realization requirement, giving the federal government carte blanche to tax ""deemed"" income without apportionment.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

If they prevail, that would confirm that the Supreme Court's precedents generally requiring apportionment and limiting the exception for taxes on ""income"" to its common understanding remain good law, clearly barring any kind of federal property tax, including a wealth tax—unless Congress apportions it, which there is no obvious way to do. What makes the case an especially attractive vehicle to resolve this issue is the simplicity of their situation, a rarity in tax cases. There's also the timing: If the courts confirm the 16th Amendment's limited reach now, that would relieve them from having to do so in a politically explosive case directly challenging a wealth tax. The courts would do well to remind Congress at this opportune time that its taxing power is not without limits.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

His great achievement was to make that the default assumption of public debate, the paradigm under which the country would operate for decades. It held sway even during periods of Democratic rule.

Which is true: By many measures, 1980 was a real inflection point when the fortunes of the richest began shooting up, while everyone else failed to benefit from income gains. The true cruelty of the Reagan paradigm was that it enhanced the wealth and power of those at the top while not only doing everything possible to undermine working people (for instance, by launching a war on collective bargaining that continues to this day), but simultaneously going after safety net programs that assist people in financial crisis.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

But while Republicans most assuredly dislike the social infrastructure in the reconciliation bill, what really has their plutocrat wing up in arms are the parts of the bill that aren't revolutionary: the tax increases. The tax provisions are mostly tweaks to a system that still embodies much of what Reagan achieved. When he came into office, the top income tax rate was 70 percent.

It would raise it from the current 37 percent to 39.6 percent, as modest a bump as you could imagine. Other provisions would increase taxes on the wealthy, but even if they became law, Wall Street titans won't be trading in their Porsches for Priuses and selling their houses in the Hamptons. They'll just have to pay a bit more — a hit they'll hardly notice. The same is true of corporate taxes. For most of Reagan's tenure, the top corporate rate was 46 percent. The 2017 Republican tax cut slashed it from 35 percent to 21 percent.

(""It's the legacy of decades of systemic discrimination against black women. Discrimination in pay. Discrimination in housing. Discrimination in finance. Discrimination in health care,"" she said.

Or will these natural allies take advantage of a historic opportunity to strengthen American democracy, defeat both Trumpism and an increasingly radical form of conservatism, and create a broad alliance for practical, visionary government? Judging from the tone of the Democratic primary on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, feuding seems to be winning. Some of this contention is inevitable; each of these candidates wants to win. The danger lies in fostering the idea that the divides between progressives and moderates are more important than their intense and shared opposition with President Trump and a right-wing version of Republicanism that seeks to undo our nation's advances since the New Deal.

Is this election about restoration, after the madness of Trump's time in office? Or should the accent be on transformation, to grapple with the underlying problems that led to Trump's election in the first place? E.J. Dionne Jr. writes about politics in a twice-weekly column for The Washington Post. This essay is adapted from his book, ""Code Red: How Progressives and Moderates Can Unite to Save Our Country."" Illustrations by Ellen Weinstein for The Washington Post Thanks to his personality, background and experience, former vice president Joe Biden is the premier restorationist. Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) both represent what Warren, in her oft-repeated promise, has called ""big structural change."" Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) stand somewhere in between. They are closer to Biden philosophically but, as new voices in the national conversation, have a chance to argue that they represent a break with the past. And looking past the early contests, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg clearly falls into the restorationist camp.	1	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The country can't simply pick up where it left off before Trump took office. The radicalized conservatism that dominates the Republican Party will not go away even if he is defeated. The inequalities of class and race that helped fueled Trump's rise have deepened during his presidency. You might say restoring the norms that Trump threatens requires transformation. And the majority that opposes Trump is clearly seeking a combination of restoration and transformation. They want to bring back things they believe have been lost as a prelude to moving forward. What they want most to restore is progress.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

They reject overt appeals to racism that have been Trump's calling card and an approach to politics based on dividing the nation. Together, they long for a politics focused on freedom, fairness and the future. What should bring moderates and progressives together is an idea put forward long ago by the late social thinker Michael Harrington: ""visionary gradualism."" The phrase captures an insight from each side of their debate: Progressives are right that reforms unhinged from larger purposes are  typically ephemeral. But a vision disconnected from first steps and early successes can shrivel up and die. Vision and incremental change are not opposites. In our nation's history, the two have reinforced each other — for example, in protecting the environment, achieving social security for the elderly and assistance to the unemployed, protecting civil rights, and expanding health insurance coverage. This lesson will apply for any new Democratic president, no matter which wing of the party she or he represents.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

It has been a long time since Democrats were willing to revel unreservedly in the success of one of their own. Only Franklin D. Roosevelt stands as a Democratic icon in the manner that Ronald Reagan still serves as a Republican idol.

In the face of such skepticism, I would insist that it's important to recognize both the Clinton and Obama presidencies as successful. Doing so does not mean ignoring frustrations over the degree to which both men continued to operate within the Reagan consensus, failed to create durable electoral legacies beyond their own times in office and left behind deep economic inequalities that Democrats ought to be in the business of reversing.

After a round of debates in July 2019, Democratic presidential candidates — Biden was the exception — came under criticism from many quarters for spending more time criticizing Obama's legacy than standing up for it. They engaged in a strategic correction in a September debate, competing over who could praise Obama more lavishly. As for Clinton, there were reasons he received such a rapturous reception at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. He was, after all, the man who ended 12 years of Republican control of the White House. And the 1990s really were years of exceptional economic growth — and relative peace.	6	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Both left behind thriving economies. Both pushed against rising inequality, in contrast to Republican administrations since Reagan that aggravated the inequities in our economy with large tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy. (President George H.W. Bush was an exception to this pattern.)

In Clinton's case, he pushed these assumptions further along with a broad deregulatory program for banks and the financial industry, genuinely damaging limits on the entitlement for welfare and an enthusiastic embrace of free trade. Obama inherited an economic disaster created by the irresponsibility of Wall Street and the world of finance. In cooperation with other national leaders, he righted a global economy in free fall (an achievement for which he still gets too little credit). But he repaired the system without challenging the institutions and structures that led to the disaster in the first place. At the end of the Obama presidency, the overall economy was humming again. But the damage of the 2008 crash was still being felt in many parts of the country — and many of those places produced substantial electoral swings from Obama to Trump in 2016.	8	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Did they leave behind serious social and economic imbalances they should have done more to right? Also, yes. That is why their presidencies present such conundrums to progressives. Let's start with the obvious: Clinton's relationship with a White House intern that led to his impeachment came under renewed and even harsher scrutiny after the rise of the #MeToo movement. This has affected overall assessments of his presidency, more so as the years have gone by. His legacy would be received differently if his time in office had been followed by a successful Al Gore presidency. As it was, George W. Bush's policies further aggravated inequalities, and the economic crash on his watch was a disaster for the already vulnerable.	9	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Economic growth in the late 1990s was exceptional, disadvantaged groups enjoyed strong income gains, and government (through programs such as an expanded earned-income tax credit) sought to redistribute some of the largesse the economy was producing. The country's strong fiscal position left room for further redistribution efforts. It's also important to remember that Clinton won reelection in 1996 in part because of his success in resisting Republican cuts to ""Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment,"" his battle cry that helped stop Newt Gingrich's ""revolution"" in its tracks.	10	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Bush — sped along deindustrialization that had begun in the 1970s and 1980s. The brunt of these policies hit hardest in the historically industrial states that moved to Trump in 2016. Trade was by no means the only driver here. Automation and technological change were as important, but promises of relief for those hurt by foreign trade never materialized in a substantial way. And confidence that an economically expansive China would move toward democracy proved entirely misplaced.	11	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The Clinton-era belief was that ""the best way to achieve progressive policy goals was by harnessing and redirecting the wealth that a less-regulated and more-innovative private sector alone could generate."" What Kilgore called the ""create-then-redistribute model for Democratic economic policy"" effectively passed away after the financial crisis in 2008. It shouldn't be hard to understand that Obama was so fearful of a comprehensive economic collapse during his first months in office that he resisted putting pressure on the financial sector. Still, he could have done more to hold it accountable once the emergency passed. The Dodd-Frank financial reform was certainly a major step forward — important enough that the Trump administration set to work dismantling large parts of it — but it was less far-reaching than it could have been.	12	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The most ""socialist"" and, at the time, controversial of Obama's policies — the bailout of the auto industry involving massive government subsidy and large-scale federal intervention — was one of his most successful ventures, substantively and politically. The auto industry came back, and none of the fears of the program's critics were realized. And there is little doubt that Obama's support for rescuing the industry and Mitt Romney's opposition to it were key to Obama's 2012 victories in both Michigan and Ohio.	13	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

And his stimulus was decidedly progressive in moving money to Americans with the lowest incomes and investing in clean energy. His signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, reflected what might be seen as the classic Obama synthesis. It took ideas from conservatives (the health-care exchanges, insurance subsidies, the mandate to buy insurance) to produce far-reaching social change. But there is, again, the paradox of centrism: The plan might have been even more popular — and Obama's party might have been saved from its current divisive health-care debate — if the proposal had included a public option alongside private insurance. That feature was killed in part because of opposition from moderate Senate Democrats, to say nothing of Republicans.	14	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

This made a second, much-needed stimulus package even more politically difficult than it already was. As the economics writer Noam Scheiber noted in his book, ""The Escape Artists,"" Obama ""spent much of his first term more taken with the case against deficits than with the case for jobs."" It was, in the oldest sense of the term, a conservative preoccupation. Obama's crack at balance brought him criticism from both right and left. Many among the wealthy condemned him as a socialist who did not appreciate the heroism of entrepreneurs (whom he had in fact helped rescue). Progressives saw his administration as more interested in nursing Wall Street back to health than in curtailing its excesses. The financial sector emerged as powerful as ever and, in the Trump years, began the process of dismantling the reforms Obama had signed into law and the regulations he had put in place. Obama was caught in the middle of all this — ""middle"" being the appropriate word in many respects.	15	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Pete Buttigieg underscored the costs of this by noting that throughout his own lifetime, ""Reagan supply-side conservatism … created the terms for how Democrats as well as Republicans made policy."" This bottled up enormous pressure on the left. It was bound, eventually, to explode. In 2016, it did, in the form of Bernie Sanders's campaign and the reappearance of democratic socialism as an energetic force in American politics.

Summers to argue that ""even apolitical economists looking at the 'widening inequality, financial crisis, zero interest rates, rising gaps in life expectancy and opportunity' over the past two decades would move to the left, because their analysis would inevitably lead them there.""

Among them, he said, was underestimating the effect of trade liberalization on a significant number of blue-collar workers and ""the speed and ferocity with which technology would decimate certain sectors of the American workforce."" A particularly negative effect of this was the ""concentration of opportunity"" in certain regions as large parts of the country were left behind.

The political center can no longer be a halfway point between Democrats and Republicans because the GOP has veered so far to the right. The New York Times' David Leonhardt described the new terrain well: Most voters don't share the centrist preferences of Washington's comfortable pundit class. Most voters want to raise taxes on the rich and corporations. They favor generous Medicare and Social Security, expanded Medicaid, more financial aid for college, a higher minimum wage and a bigger government role in job creation. Remember, Trump won the Republican nomination as a populist. A clear majority of Americans wants the government to respond aggressively to our economic problems.	20	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

At such a moment, moderates should welcome, not fear, the left's boldness. A vibrant left has always been a central component of any successful era of social reform. By offering plans and proposals on what Harrington called ""the left wing of the possible,"" socialists, social democrats and left-liberals have redefined the political playing field. Consider that when Warren proposed a wealth tax on fortunes of $50 million or more, moderate voices responded by saying her idea was too radical or unworkable — and then urged an increase in the capital-gains tax or other approaches to taxing large fortunes instead. She had redefined the intellectual playing field; ""moderation"" now entailed ideas that were once seen as ""leftist."" As Robert Borosage noted in the Nation, Warren's proposal underscored a fundamental unfairness in the American system: that while the ""primary source of wealth for most middle-class families — their homes — is taxed each year in the property tax,"" the ""primary source of wealth of the very rich — their investments — is only taxed when sold or transferred, if then.""	21	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

And she would use the proceeds from the tax — she estimates it would raise $2.7 trillion over a decade — to finance ambitious social initiatives. This was a policy twofer. Warren simultaneously underscored just how much money is sitting at the top of the economy and then showed how much could be done to lift those at its lower rungs without resorting to broad-based tax increases. There were legitimate questions raised about how her wealth tax would work and whether it could be effective in a world in which capital can be moved around so easily. She certainly generated a backlash among billionaires, and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination was a response both to Warren's rise in the polls and Biden's perceived weaknesses. But Warren had by then already altered the discussions of how government should raise money in the future.	22	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Warren's struggles over the details of a single-payer plan showed how problematic this approach is as an immediate next step. But it is testimony to the room the idea opened in the policy debate that Post opinion writer Paul Waldman was able to say this of Biden's health plan, which includes a public option: ""In 2009 when the ACA was being a debated, a plan like this one would have been considered almost radically leftist.""

One telltale sign that a political debate is turning in a new direction is the adoption of the rising side's ideas by its adversaries. Democrats and liberals in the 1980s ratified the new Reagan disposition by beginning to speak its language and offering policies consistent with its objectives. That both Clinton and, to a lesser degree, Obama operated within this consensus is precisely why their legacies are complicated. For the most part, Republicans have resisted altering their course. Only a decisive defeat will open the space needed for a larger GOP reformation. But quietly, leading conservatives and libertarians are acknowledging contemporary capitalism's problems and adopting critiques that originated on the left. Thus did Sen. Marco Rubio (R- Fla.) issue a remarkable report last year arguing that business was underinvesting in their own workers because of a shift in corporate behavior toward valuing the interests of shareholders over all other stakeholders.

In a statement on the purpose of the corporation widely interpreted as a direct response to growing discontent with capitalism, the Business Roundtable explicitly broke with this limited view of the modern corporation's obligations, emphasizing that they extended to other ""stakeholders."" Proper corporate goals, the chief executives declared, included ""investing in our employees,"" ""supporting the communities in which we work"" and promoting ""a healthy environment."" In the meantime, the most provocative new Washington think tank on the center-right is the Niskanen Center, a haven for onetime libertarians who have had enough of hard-right ideology and are championing a new moderation in politics.

It makes little sense, either substantively or politically, for progressives and moderates to disown the legacies of Clinton and Obama. They both chipped away at the Reagan consensus even as they lived within it. In particular, each put the lie to supply-side economics by raising taxes on the wealthy and in the process fostering two periods of exceptional growth. The economic growth Trump likes to brag about was set in motion by an Obama who faced down an economic collapse. And the Affordable Care Act and the rescue of the auto industry are large achievements, monuments to the good that creative government can do. Moreover, Obama's eloquent arguments for racial justice and interracial peace — his 2015 speech on the 50th anniversary of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Selma, Ala., will long stand as the definitive argument for America's capacity to change — are an antidote to the divisiveness of the Trump era.	27	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The spectacle of so much wealth in the hands of people who can’t use it productively, while the majority of Americans struggle to make ends meet on working-class wages, is profoundly unhealthy. Why is economic inequality growing in America? Blame the lack of tax enforcement. Obviously Trump and his Republican fellows aren’t alone in their addiction to big contributions from the wealthy.

Of the 63 billionaire donors to Trump Victory, nine have made their money in natural resources — oil and gas, fracking, timber and coal mining. Trump has favored fossil fuels over renewable energy sources and facilitated more resource exploitation on federal lands. At least seven are in real estate development (not counting more general investors who may have money in real estate assets). The 2017 tax cut enacted by Trump and the GOP majorities in Congress left open a tax loophole related to asset swaps in real estate while closing it for almost everyone else.

2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	What bothers me is if we don’t look at what the fastest growing jobs are right now, which are one- and two-year degree jobs. [According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the fastest growing jobs in the country include: home health aides, personal care aides, information security analysts, occupational therapy assistants and a large number of other occupations that, as Senator Klobuchar points out, don’t rely on advanced degrees like M.B.A.s.] So we’re not going to have a shortage of M.B.A.s or C.E.O.s. We’re going to have a shortage of plumbers. We’re going to have a shortage of home health care workers. We’re going to have over a million home health care workers open those jobs in the next 10 years, and we’re going to have a hundred and something thousand openings for nurse assistants and we’re to have 64,000 job openings for plumbers. And so how do you make sure that we are, one, paying people enough — that’s the dignity of work — to do these jobs, but then also making sure our education system is fitting with our economy? Where does that lead me to with the pipe dream and the plan? Well that says, O.K., what’s the best policy, but also how can we get it done?	16	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	I think that there is huge support out there even in conservative areas for things like — I’ve watched it in my own state. They vote for bonding referendums in the most conservative [places] if they see that, oh, our high school needs more robotics equipment and we need to make sure that we are matching the jobs in our community because we don’t have enough people working at that plant or we don’t have enough nurses or doctors in the hospital. So they’ll pay for that. What does that make me think? O.K., how can we get the public big time behind this plan? Hook it in with the economy. And so that’s where I end up with one- and two-year degrees free and then doubling the Pell grants, which would help very much with the students that need it the most. Expanding the income level from $50,000 to $100,000, and so that would give a lot more help to the people that need it most. Not sending wealthy kids to college for free, but instead making sure that we’re helping the people that need it the most.

If you allow multimillionaires to refinance their yacht, maybe you should allow students to refinance their loans. But you also fix that loan payback program that Betsy DeVos has so messed up. And you fix that for those in public service, including teachers, but you also actually extend it, and you extend it to other jobs, in-demand jobs. And that could really help us to match up those degrees with what’s happening in our economy. And of course investing in H.B.C.U.s and all of the areas where you’re going to see where the students are that actually need the help.	18	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

AK: I think part of this is we have to look — even when you look at countries that do this more, I think they try to match their economy with what their jobs are. So I would rephrase it in a different way than, “Why can’t the richest country in the world do this?” I would say, “Why can’t one of the most advanced, if not the most advanced countries in the world figure out how to make our education system work for our students so that they’re able to be functioning members of our economy in a good way and are able to make a living?”	19	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It’s also about when they are doing a job that we need them to do — like working in a nursing home or fixing someone’s plumbing — how do we make sure that they have enough to raise their family? So I would just look at it differently. I don’t think we should be telling everyone that they should get a four-year degree. I think we should figure out what they want to do with their lives, with some incentives for them to do things that work in our economy and getting more people into technology and science and nursing instead of sports marketing degrees.

I think this is about looking at our economy and making sure our workers are being able to have a high quality of life and raise a family with the jobs that we have available now. [Again, a number of 2020 candidates have released plans calling for free public four-year college for all, including Senators Sanders and Warren.

[In 2017, the editorial board ran a nine-part series examining domestic violence and guns, including a call to close the so-called boyfriend loophole. The series was recognized as a Pulitzer finalist for editorial writing. Read more here.] That’s my bill right now. I lead that provision and Debbie Dingell took it on in the House after I introduced the bill. That is in the Violence Against Women Act. It’s what’s stopping that bill.

I can’t do immigration reform with the exception of changing some of his policies at the border without Congress. So you can do two things at once. I’m a mom.

Don’t you think it’s possible, and even likely, that those appointees might look not as favorably on a President Klobuchar’s executive orders? AK: I suppose. But I really suggest you look at the list because it’s really defined. You can start the gun violence research at the C.D.C. There’s a bunch of things that actually are just decisions of his administration — there are some things that Obama had done that they reversed. The domestic gag order, the international gag order, the funding of Planned Parenthood. These are things that were executive orders that you can change. So there’s a number like that. And then there’s some things that are new ideas. So look at the list because I think every one of them is legal.	28	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Both of them contributed to the loss of the House by Democrats. [President Clinton proposed an energy tax in his 1993 State of the Union, which was passed in the House but rejected by the Senate after a coordinated, largely business-driven lobbying effort against it.

I was on the committee at the time. [Senator Klobuchar was a member of the Senate Commerce Committee.] I obviously supported the bill, but I remember thinking among many things that was the worst name of a bill ever, “Cap and Trade.” I think everyone thought it was fine because former Senator McCain in the debates with President Obama had said he was for cap and trade. And then I would be in parades and people would yell, “No on trade, no on caps.” [Opponents labeled the bill “cap and tax,” and Tea Party members seized on it as a symbol of everything wrong with Washington. Even Senator John Kerry criticized it with the statement, “I don’t know what ‘cap and trade’ means.”] It was a bad name. So I would just like to start with that.	30	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	O.K., so the answer to me is you have to put a price on carbon. You can do it many ways.

Which I believe we can do if we win big, and I think the polls are starting to show that I’m right. If we can win in Kentucky and Louisiana in the governor’s race the day after Donald Trump goes down there, we can win in some of these Senate seats. So I think you can do it, one, by a tax on carbon.

Because I’m being realistic about how we get things done. And you could do a combination. You could do a renewable electricity standard, which was, by the way, my bill [Senator Klobuchar introduced a bill to create an aggressive renewable electricity standard in 2007, which would require electricity providers to generate or purchase 25 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2025.

And third, and most importantly, since everyone’s plans are really quite similar, maybe with the exception of Bernie’s, I think what we need to do is to make people understand that we’re going to keep them whole.

AK: Great question, because people don’t ask it enough. So I am the only one on that debate stage who has, again, won in areas that have a lot of hunters. My state is a big hunting state with a proud tradition of hunting and fishing. So when I look at these proposals, I say, “Do they hurt my Uncle Dick in his deer stand?” They do not.

That is why we passed universal background checks and closing the Charleston loophole and closing the boyfriend loophole in the House of Representatives, because of the new people we had put in the House. This is the moment that the Senate has to change and this is going to be one of the big issues in this campaign. I just see this trend and they are in the pocket of the N.R.A. I saw it firsthand. I — as the one seated across — you can watch the video, President Trump, after Parkland, in the White House with a group that had come there to advocate for gun safety legislation.

I actually headed up the county attorney’s office, the biggest prosecutor’s office in Minnesota, that was bigger than actually our attorney general’s office because it wasn’t just prosecutors. It was half prosecutors and it was half civil. I provided the legal work for the biggest public hospital in our state and did — it was a big law office actually. And I did that for eight years. And so the way I approach my job is that we were ministers of justice. That our job was to, yes convict the guilty, but protect the innocent. That our job was not to be like a business and that we didn’t want to see repeat customers. So my priority was to make our county safe, but it was also to figure out how do you best make it safe. [Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, The Star Tribune, a Minnesota newspaper, emphasized Senator Klobuchar’s “tough on crime platform” and “police-have-endorsed-me, law-and-order campaign,” according to a Vox report. Senator Klobuchar wrote of her intent to “put repeat and violent offenders behind bars” and “hold judges accountable for sentences.”]	44	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	So that’s why I did a lot of work when it came to drug courts, something I continued in the Senate. I have been the lead on getting the federal funding for drug court. [Senator Klobuchar received an award from the National Association of Drug Courts Professionals for her work advocating government support of drug courts in the Senate.] And that is a really good way to get people out of the system and get them the treatment they need. I did a lot of work with mental health and a lot of this came from, the reason I came up with the proposal on this is because I think it is the really not talked about issue. One in five Americans struggle with mental health sometimes in their lives and as you’ve done with your reporting on the opioid epidemic, there’s a lot of dirty hands when it comes to that. And a lot of money is going to come in from this master federal settlement that should be used to help people. Comes from the heart for me. My dad struggled with alcoholism his whole life. By the time he had his third D.W.I., he was faced with this tough love situation: jail or treatment. And he chose treatment, and his life changed. In his words, he was pursued by grace and I believe everyone should have that same right.	45	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	So with criminal justice, number one, what I think we need to do is pass the Second Step Act. I was a co-sponsor of the First Step Act [The First Step Act, a bipartisan prison reform bill signed into law in December 2018, “is showing that past injustices can be corrected,” the editorial board wrote last June.] and involved in that bill. I thought it was very important for racial justice. I thought it was important for the economics of our country. If we are cutting out a bunch of people that should be able to participate in our economy and vote and everything, that’s wrong.	46	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	Second Step Act would look at the fact that 90 percent of the people incarcerated right now are in state and local jail. And it would create incentives to reduce those sentences. If you ask what happens if the crime rate goes up and how would you respond? Well, I of course, in eight years as prosecutor, there were all kinds of heinous crimes that happened during that time. So you should look at how I responded. What I did is advocate for changes that would work. We needed better computer records. There were judges that were pretending that they knew someone’s record when they sentenced them, “Hey kid, I know what you’ve done before”; blank screen. It was easier for Target to find a pair of shoes with a SKU number in Hawaii than it was us to figure that out. And we did that.	47	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	Actually, Governor Pawlenty, there was a horrible murder that occurred in the rural part of our state and to his credit, did he advocate for the death penalty? Which by the way, I’m sure he did at some point, but he didn’t then. He advocated for better computer records with me. And I have been long against the death penalty. My husband is a scholar on the death penalty. He’s written seven books. He wrote the preface for Justice Breyer’s dissenting opinion, that Brookings published. So if I did something like that, I’d probably not be still married. So I have my own strong views about this. So you don’t see me calling for those kinds of things. I call for things because death penalty, states that have it, have worse crime rates a lot of time. I call for things that I think makes sense in each situation and policy solutions that work and that was my history. You can talk to the Innocence Project. I was one of the first prosecutors that did a different form of eyewitness identification, that you would show the pictures, not all at once, but one by one instead. [In 2006, while Senator Klobuchar was serving her second term as Hennepin County Attorney, her office developed a pilot program to improve eyewitness identification procedures, including “blind sequential lineups,” in which subjects are presented to the witness one at a time. Read the report Senator Klobuchar co-authored about the pilot here.] I did a DNA review of our whole office. I tried my best and there are things that you’d do differently now. Back then for police shootings, we used a grand jury. Everyone was doing that in our state, every single prosecutor’s office. I think it would be better for the prosecutor to claim and take responsibility for those decisions now. So I would have done that differently. So you always look at these things you would change.	48	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	But I think overall with criminal justice, you hit it on the head. It’s not how you’re doing when — crime is low, it’s what you do — in my case, crime, it stayed pretty steady and went down a little when I was in, and African-American incarceration went down 12 percent during my time in my county — but the question is what do you do either when it’s up or I think really illustratively it’s when there’s a heinous crime.

AK: Besides a few boyfriends that still gave me money when I asked them? [LAUGHTER] Who has broken my heart? O.K., so here we go. Lindsey Graham’s broken my heart lately in the political system. [Senator Lindsey Graham has transformed from a Trump critic, who called the president “xenophobic” and “race-baiting,” to one of his most staunch supporters. He told The Times Magazine, “If you don’t want to get re-elected, you’re in the wrong business.”] Just because I like him and know him really well and traveled with him and Senator McCain all over the, all over the world. I’m just more thinking of Senator McCain and how much I miss him right now because I think he would have been really strong on Ukraine and on standing up against some of the things the president did and he’s no longer with us. And Lindsey and McCain and I were actually on the front line with former President Poroshenko in a blizzard on New Year’s Eve, and I think about this now every New Year’s Eve — because John McCain wanted to show — after Trump got elected — wanted to show those countries that we were on their side.	50	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	And so of course I was disappointed with how the Kavanaugh hearing was handled. I think everyone could see me on TV to see that, but I just hope that he has the ability to rise up here, and has a very important job right now as chair of the Judiciary Committee and certainly smart enough and has shown some tendency in the past to stand up for things and I just wish he would do it again when it comes to this conduct and a whole range of issues about our judicial system.

2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	AK: I did. After the Kavanaugh hearing, we had a little skirmish and leave it, put it behind us. [After Justice Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearing, where Senator Klobuchar grilled him on his history of alcohol use among other subjects, Senator Graham said she owed the justice an apology for participating in a “smear campaign” against him.] But one thing he did do that was good is — the work that we did together on the — he took over the Honest Ads Act from Senator McCain when Senator McCain died. And that’s my bill where I took on the social media companies — before it was cool — to say that they should have to put disclaimers and show how they pay for ads and have them on file. He did that with me, and he’s done a few other things with me.	52	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	KK: So the last time I saw you was in a small town called Wyoming, Iowa. Many of the people there, as for other millions of Americans, have church and religion at the center of their communities. Can you talk a little bit about your own spirituality? Do you believe in God? Who are your closest spiritual advisers? AK: Mm-hmm. Well, I believe in God. I have a deep faith. You just heard me talk about my dad, and I don’t think he would have come through that without his faith and our family’s faith and would have been able to be where he is now. And so for me, that was just an important part of my life growing up. He didn’t go to church. My mom couldn’t drive until I was 16, unclear why this happened. She got her license when I was 16 and took her first drive out and ran into the plate-glass window of a carwash. But other than that, it was all good. [LAUGHTER] But when we would go to, she would still take the cab to church. We weren’t rich by any means, and yet she wanted to have us go to church, and he wasn’t there. So she would take us in this cab, and I would always have to say, “Add 50 cents please,” which is my earliest memory of going to church because I felt if I forgot this, that then the driver would be denied a tip. And I later found out the tip was baked in already, but she just wanted to teach me that you’re supposed to add a tip. So that was my life.	53	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	I was in the, and still am, Congregational, the U.C.C. church, and there’s one right by our house right now in Minnesota. And so that was important to me growing up. And then when I got to the Senate, I joined the Prayer Breakfast, which is not as maybe, I don’t know what you guys think that it’s, it’s actually a really amazing thing. It’s usually like half Democrats, half Republicans. Senator Coons just — I chaired it for a number of years and Senator King is involved in it. It’s just Senator Kaine, and about 80 of the senators speak there every two years, I’d say, 70, 80 over their time. And they don’t always talk about religion. They talk about something personal in their life. We can never talk about what they say. I think one of them was public after he died. Senator Inouye came near the end of his life and spoke about what it was like to be in World War II, and it was this amazing thing and his recovery in the hospital. So not a lot of religious discussion in his presentation on that, but that’s what it’s like. And everything’s that said in that room, stays in that room. And there’s a number of Republicans involved in that who’ve been really helpful on things like foreign aid. I’ve gotten to know them because of that. And then I actually got to chair the National Prayer Breakfast with Johnny Isakson at a very interesting time. I will not tell that whole story, if you want to know it later, I will. And when President Obama was first elected, and so I’ve spoken there as recently as a few years ago. So that is my faith.	54	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

He’s an amazing guy. I am someone that doesn’t talk about it a lot. I think it’s personal, and I respect the separation of church and state. So I don’t — you don’t see me talking about it all the time in my remarks. Just one other thing I want to say though about that event you were at in Wyoming. This is a legislator who changed parties. He was a Republican and last spring he made, in a very dramatic fashion on the Iowa Statehouse floor, said why he changed parties.

Many suggest Welch’s comments eventually led to the end of McCarthy’s crusade. Read more here.] and said — that guy was from Iowa, Joseph Welch.

2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	And the reason I bring that up is because you saw what happened at that event. That event, because that guy had changed parties and this is not a blue district, was about a third Republicans, about a third of his friends that are kind of apolitical and then a third like Democratic-base people. And what you saw in that room when [State Auditor Rob] Sand spoke — the newspaper just featured a story on him.

This election is an economic check on our country, and that’s why our debates had been so focused on things like health care and college and what we’re going to do on foreign policy. Yes, but it is also a patriotism check. It is a values check. It is a decency check, and that’s what you felt in that room. Because they just can’t stomach having this guy in office for four more years. They are the rancher that told me that he couldn’t, the last he had voted for Trump, but when he saw him standing in front of that wall, and I thought that wall was “the wall.” But no, it was the C.I.A. wall with those stars on it of the agents who died in the line of duty, that that was it for him.

And I say to him, “Ah, you don’t have a sticker on.” And he whispers to me, “Because I was a Trump voter. Don’t tell them, they don’t know. But I can’t vote for him again.” That’s what’s going on in this country. And so my profound message is, we cannot screw this up, because there are people that see what’s going on, regardless of even what they think of impeachment. They see this going on, and they don’t want their kids to have this guy as president. And that’s why when we look at the differences on issues, we have to remember that what unites our country is bigger than what divides us.	59	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

As you well know, there has been a lot of reporting, including in The New York Times, about the work environment that you have in the Senate. One of the more troubling parts of that reporting, to my mind, was the fact that you have the highest turnover in the Senate. [A Times report in February 2019 explored Senator Klobuchar’s history of harsh behavior toward her staff. The website LegiStorm reported that her Senate office had the highest rates of staff turnover for years, and Senator Klobuchar herself said: “Have I pushed people too hard?

I hope you meet the people outside in the hall, which includes Tom Sullivan, who was my deputy for years and ended up as John Kerry’s chief policy person or his brother, Jake Sullivan, who I brought to Washington. He’s not out there now, but he’s a great example. I have hired people of extraordinary talent, and that is the reason that I passed over a hundred bills. I know I can be tough on people and push people, and you can always do better. But I ask you to look at some other metrics. And including, if you look at the latest, my turnover rate is actually less than any of the other presidential candidates from over the last year, because I keep track of it, except for I think Bernie and Michael Bennet. [Senator Cory Booker and Senator Warren had higher staff turnover rates than Senator Klobuchar in the fiscal year 2019, according to Legistorm. However, Legistorm advises against making one-year comparisons, saying “For comparison purposes, we discourage one-year-only comparisons between most members and those who have special reasons why staff might leave the office.” Senator Klobuchar had the highest staff turnover rate of all senators in the fiscal years 2001-2018.] So just look at the update on that.	61	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-15	New York Times (Online)	Amy Klobuchar on Plans vs. Pipe Dreams	txt-opeds/2339454372.xml.txt	Also, I have a number of people that have gone on to great things. I had a different hiring model, and there’s a few other senators that do this. I have hired people that I kind of know may go work at the time for President Obama after a few years. But I wanted their talent. Many of them come back. I’ve had over 20 people that went to high ranking positions in his administration. The other proof point you’ve got, which I think is quite significant, is my presidential campaign. I may not be the leading candidate right now, but I have beaten like 19 people, including every governor. And so you can’t run a presidential campaign if you have a dysfunctional work environment. My campaign manager is the same one I’ve had for 14 years. My state director has been with me for seven years. My chief of staff is out there in the hallway. She’s on the campaign side, but the acting chief of staff has been with me for four years and is on her third baby. I’ve hired a lot of women. They have a lot of babies. They leave, they come back, whatever. It’s just a different hiring model. And so I am very proud of the work that we’ve done and the standards that we’ve set and like I said, you can always do better, but look at my presidential campaign and how we have hung together and talk to any of your reporters that have dealt with them.

[Senator Klobuchar has sparred with Senator Warren at several recent debates, confronting her about the reach and expense of her health care and tax plans.] [LAUGHTER] Ask some of the other candidates. And when you look at, even through all my Senate races, I have been always, I think, displayed grace under pressure. Whether it was the Kavanaugh hearings, whether how I’ve acted in the debates, whether how I act when I’m out on the trail and you get some, the occasional angry question. I think that’s really important in a president right now. Because we’ve got a guy that goes after people and says bad things about people and goes after immigrants and people of color literally almost nearly every day. And so having someone that shows that grace under pressure, maybe that means you don’t have a viral moment.

And it feels like at this point in America’s history here that people are going to look for that because they get how important that is. So that’s one thing.

You want people that will be willing to disagree with you, hopefully not publicly, but be willing to tell you very strongly how they feel so you get a different perspective on things. I think that is one of the most dangerous things that’s happened with the Trump administration right now. Not only the people right around him, but the people in that cabinet. When you lose people like General Mattis, and other people, that could be the counterweight.

Because I actually have gone out of my way to make clear that I’m running on my merits, which of course I still am and I will, and let me just explain that. When I’ve run for the D.A.’s job, I was the first woman in that job. When I ran for U.S. Senate in my state, two very qualified women had — one the secretary of state, one a majority leader for the State Senate — each decade had tried to run and lost.

So if I was just running as a woman, it wouldn’t work.” And they go, “Yeah.” I think what that is, is everyone, regardless of who they are or what gender, that they want to know that someone has their back. That is how I have done my work, and it’s been very straightforward concept of being a representative and what I would do as president. You listen to them, and you try to get things done.

They voted for — and those are executive jobs. So I lead with those. They have done, that and they will do it again. But right now it’s a mess. There’s so many candidates.

But I think, and I think a lot of people would say this, but I think one of the ways you could do it, which is what you’re referring to that I’ve talked about, is investing in communities that have been in poverty for literally centuries, but decade after decade after decade.

And that’s looking at federal funding — I think it’s for agriculture areas, but you could extend it on to make sure — here’s more investment.

Or the fact that African-American women make something like 60 cents for every a dollar that a white man makes. So we know that it’s there, and you have to have a president that gets that and is willing to say it. From there, you move not just to reparations but to actual economic opportunity.

MG: Senator, as a follow-up, what role do you see racism playing in American politics today, and what would you do to address it? AK: Sure. It’s a major undercurrent and fact in American politics today furthered by the president, who I’ve clearly said I believe is racist and it is furthered by the rhetoric. It’s furthered by the criminal justice system, which we’ve discussed. It is furthered by the economic injustices.

I think there’s two ways you can do this, and then, of course, a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United and get dark money out of our politics and there’s tons of different things you can do on the road to that. What is missing here is, I look at how we won gay marriage or how the country won gay marriage. And, yes, it ended up being in court, but it was a libertarian argument in a lot of states like mine. So in — my state, a group which did an incredible job to defeat — which was the only time it was defeated — a constitutional amendment in a purple state that would have limited marriage to man and woman, basically.

AK: With the Uighurs. SS: The Uighurs and other Muslim minorities. Can or should the United States take action on their behalf? AK: I think the United States should be standing up much taller on this front, both with Hong Kong, and you see Congress acted on that front with authorizing some sanctions and passing a law which the Trump administration grudgingly signed. But I think when it comes to the Uighurs, the stories that your newspaper uncovered of kids that are off in college and then they come home and there is no family, there’s no parents, and they’re off in what appears to be some kind of modern day camps where they have been sent. And it’s outrageous. And it, unlike some of these things, it seems like something you could really work with your allies — again, not alone — to push a resolution and get those people home. It’s a human rights debacle and a crisis and we should be elevating it on the international stage.	103	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

JD: To flood Hong Kong streets with troops and crack down violently, what do you think you would do? AK: Well, first of all, again, standing taller and working with our allies I think would be key. [Senator Klobuchar has said that “in economic terms,” China is America’s top national security threat. She has favored strong trade measures, but criticized President Trump’s trade war with China and noted that it has hurt Midwestern farmers.] If you remember how this all started, it was when Carrie Lam wanted to get a new law that would have allowed the extradition of political prisoners, well all prisoners but including political prisoners. And that’s what sparked this. She has since backed down from that, but it just shows that this spark, this protest — and you’ve got to allow for these protests and you’ve got to push on civil liberties for people. But again, I think the best way is to stand with allies, something this president has refused to do, so many times. Any time there’s a choice in a moment where he can choose, he stands with dictators over allies, or tyrants over innocents. He gets us out of these international agreements, and I’m going to give a speech on this at the Foreign Relations Council tomorrow about some of my ideas about reasserting American leadership, rejoining these international agreements.

KK: Do you feel comfortable with the United States having nuclear weapons in Southern Turkey at this point given Erdogan’s behavior? AK: It’s one of the reasons that — I was asked this and maybe it was when you guys were doing — no, it was the debate before that. Why I think that we should not push Turkey out of NATO right now, but instead be pushing them. I strongly disagreed with the president’s decision to withdraw the 150 troops from Syria on the border. [During the October Democratic debate, Senator Klobuchar was the first to raise Mr. Trump’s decision to abandon the Kurds, asking in response to a question on impeachment: “Leaving the Kurds for slaughter, how that makes America great again?”] And everything that has happened after that is really actually quite predictable. Including the initial slaughter of the Kurds, who’ve stood with us, who I met with a number of other senators, including Kirsten and Lindsey, who we’d promised all these things too. And then when they’ve fought on our side and lost like 11,000 people, we don’t stand up for them. So I think that we would want to still keep those strategic nuclear weapons there, but it’s all the more reason that we want to keep pushing Turkey and working with Turkey, but at the same time, I don’t think we want to give up that foothold right there.	105	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The Russian nuclear agreements are very, very important, and he precipitously got us out of one in the last year, which he shouldn’t have done.

I still see it as our beacon of democracy in the Mideast. But I have been horrified by some of the things that Trump has done, which has eroded support for Israel in the United States and I think has lessened their security position. I would not reverse the embassy change, but I do think that some of the things that he did recently when the administration said that the settlements were not against international law. That is in violation of longstanding American policy. And if we truly want to build support for this democracy, then we have to restart these negotiations for a two-state solution, which I would do. When I went to Israel with a number of senators, I went only — it was just me and one other senator that did this — and met with the Palestinians.

I still think that they are in a really tough neighborhood in a really dangerous position. And made worse by what Trump just did with Syria because now Iran has a foothold there. [Senator Klobuchar has criticized the Trump administration’s policies on the settlements, but she previously declined to say whether she would reverse Mr. Trump’s decision on recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and she said she would not reverse the decision to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem. However she said the embassy decision “would have been better if that was done as part of a negotiation for a two-state solution. I think it’s unfortunate it was done the way it was done but I wouldn’t reverse it.” Asked by The Times whether Israel meets international standards for human rights, she said “yes.”]	108	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

And you do that by stopping these Mitch McConnell divisive votes, making it a wedge issue, trying to play politics instead of looking at what the challenges are ahead. I think that we need to emphasize Israel’s historic support for women’s rights, working on climate change, all of these things that have been lost because of Trump’s continual effort to use this as a partisan pawn.

I want Binya to be able to ask you at least one economic question, one health care question, but I do actually want to go back to something you just said, to follow up. Why wouldn’t you move the embassy back? AK: Because I’ve always supported having the embassy there. KK: O.K. Binya, do you want to jump in? Binyamin Appelbaum: Yeah. You’ve described an infrastructure bill as your top fiscal priority, and you said that you would pay for it by raising corporate taxes. Why not just pay for it without raising corporate taxes?

And maybe right now the interest rates are low, we don’t know if that changes. But actually my infrastructure plan does have a lot of bonding and other things that would be benefited by what we’ve just talked about. So just to go over my plan: It is taking the corporate tax rate from 21 to 25. I’d actually bring it up to 28 and use $100 billion of that for the child care plan we just talked about, and work family leave. And $200 billion of it to start a debt reduction fund because I think we do have to start paying down on this, or it’s going to be on all of your kids’ and grandkids’ shoulders. [Senator Klobuchar estimates that by taking the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, her administration could raise $400 billion. Her proposal is less aggressive than those of Mayor Buttigieg and Senators Sanders and Warren, who propose 35 percent, and Mr. Biden, who proposes 28 percent.]	111	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

In this case, yes, $400 billion from that tax rate change, $150 billion from going back to international taxation, like it was during the Obama administration. The new change has created all kinds of bad things. The Infrastructure Financing Authority, which would allow matching from state and other things. The Buy America Bonds. Those last two, one is a Hoeven-Wyden proposal and the other one is Blunt-Warner. And like I said, this may be like nerdfest here, but knowing where those numbers are and how you’re actually going to put this together as a president, makes all the difference between getting it done. The difference between a plan and a pipe dream. So that’s how I would pay for it.	112	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

BA: So you talked at the top about the importance of raising the wages of workers like home health care workers. The measures you described would improve the quality of their benefits package. You mentioned raising the minimum wage. Most of them already make more than that, although not much more. What would you do specifically to increase the wages of home health care? AK: Mm-hmm. Well, first of all, I would make it easier for them to organize. And that means passing the PRO-Act, which is a bill that’s there right now, and as president I’d be leading on it. Because I truly believe, as a granddaughter of a union iron ore miner and the daughter of a union teacher and a daughter of a union newspaper man, that I wouldn’t be sitting here at the end of this long table if it wasn’t for unions. And that this kind of organizing right now is actually key to a lot of the futures for these workers.

The union movement has described sectoral bargaining as one of its basic demands during this election. You’ve not endorsed that idea; many of your opponents have.

You’re in favor of it or you’re not? AK: No, I am in favor of it. I just want to talk about what I think we need to do in addition to that. [Senators Sanders and Warren have released plans endorsing the concept of sectoral bargaining, in which unions bargain at the level of sectors, like the fast food industry, rather than with individual companies.

Because it is wages, but it’s not just wages. And not everyone’s going to be in a union even though I want to make it easier to get in a union. So what do you do? You pass this national child care program. The one that I favor says that anyone at over 150 percent median income, your income, not more than 7 percent of it should be spent on child care. If you do that, you’re going to help a lot of these people who, while they may be making a decent wage, they can’t afford to go to work because they have no place to bring their kids and you want them to be in the work force. I would support, as we talked about, the retirement accounts and all kinds of things that could actually be done on a federal level that would create the kind of help that people need.

You’ve laid out a $100 billion plan to address the opioid crisis, mental illness, suicide prevention. It was exciting because it’s stuff that doesn’t get a lot of attention. Can you talk about, with respect to paying for that, one of the things you’ve called for is a master opioid settlement. Can you talk about how you would ensure that that money gets put to the right use? [Senator Klobuchar made anti-addiction plans an early focus of her campaign, both because of her family experience with addiction and, she said, because of the number of voters she has met who struggle with it. Senator Klobuchar’s “master settlement agreement” on opioids would essentially mean one large settlement with the government and funds going to states to fund treatment and social services, rather than piecemeal settlements with pharmaceutical companies and distributors.] So with the global tobacco settlement, for example, we saw a lot of the money got diverted to shoring up state budgets.

Because I know exactly what you’re talking about with the tobacco settlement. How I paid for the $100 billion was the $18 billion on closing the hedge fund loophole was. It was 14. It’s gone up to 18, the score on it. Fourteen billion from this master settlement, which is for opioids.

And giving them cruises for incentives. I mean it’s an outrageous situation and it’s — JI: So you would prioritize? AK: Right. So this $40 billion from that, then the $40 billion from a 2 cents per milligram fee on opioids, which the governor here did, I think, in New York. But you do that and then you’ve got — anyway, I’ve laid out the $100 billion, and I just think you have to make this a big priority. There is bipartisan support for this. Senator Portman and I, and at the time, Kelly Ayotte and Sheldon Whitehouse, led the initial opioid blueprint bill. And I’ve done a lot of work in this area. My state’s the home of Hazelden Betty Ford, so I know what — [The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation is America’s largest nonprofit addiction treatment center, created in 2013 from the merger of the Betty Ford Center (named for the former first lady) and the Hazelden Foundation.

How do you decide which programs to fund? There’s been a lot of malfeasance with respect to addiction. AK: I am pretty obsessed with this. I’ve tried to figure out, for instance, Suboxone, and is it really working? This is the drug that you give people to get them off opioids. JI: That’s pretty much standard of care now, right?

[LAUGHTER] AK: But they were on call, and they couldn’t figure out why people were getting opioids. They went back and looked at all the records and figured out that half the people had no reason to have opioids, and that half their town, that’s an exaggeration, was addicted. They actually developed this treatment method because they didn’t really have the facilities to do it from Little Falls, Minn. So it is a good thing, and it helps a lot, but there may be other treatments that we should be doing. And there’s one other thing I want to stress here: it’s that meth, crack cocaine, these other drugs, especially crack cocaine, is still a big addiction in communities of color. Alcoholism is still there. So I think it’s really important that the master settlement be used for all forms of addiction. Many of these treatment places, they are not opioid-only, and you’re really ripping off certain parts of the country if you don’t also include them in the treatment. And then I, of course, include mental health because it’s the only way we’re going to get the funding to help with mental health, when we’ve had a 30 percent increase in suicides in 15 years. O.K. Yes. [In 1998, big tobacco companies agreed to a master settlement agreement with 46 states, which forced the companies to pay tens of billions upfront as well as additional annual installments.

2021-07-22	The Washington Post (Online)	Polling is broken. No one knows how to fix it.	txt-opeds/2554150809.xml.txt	The polls are not all right. According to a new report by the American Association for Public Opinion Research (AAPOR), national polls overstated Joe Biden's margin of victory by 3.9 percentage points in 2020 — the largest error in 40 years. State polls missed too, by 4.3 points. And, for the third time in four elections, pollsters underestimated Republican votes. Why? The AAPOR report doesn't identify the reason, but it names some plausible culprits. One likely problem: Large segments of the electorate do not answer when the pollsters call. This problem (known as ""nonresponse"") can take many forms. Maybe Donald Trump's biggest fans — or those who distrust the media most — refused to take calls from pollsters, giving wishy-washy Republicans who might favor Biden too much weight. At the same time, it may be that Democrats, who were more likely to stay home during the coronavirus pandemic, more willingly picked up calls from pollsters while Republicans, who tended to be more covid-skeptical, let the phone ring.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-07-22	The Washington Post (Online)	Polling is broken. No one knows how to fix it.	txt-opeds/2554150809.xml.txt	Another possible source of error: record turnout. High turnout is, generally speaking, a good thing — it means people are interested in politics and want their voices to be heard. But it makes polling more challenging. The danger is twofold: In a high turnout year, a poll could easily underestimate the number of new voters; and a poll could get the wrong mix of first-time Democratic and Republican voters. A third possible issue: the modeling. Pollsters do not report their raw data directly to consumers — they typically apply statistical adjustments ahead of time to improve accuracy. Some adjustments are uncontroversial: Pollsters often struggle to contact enough young and non-White voters, so they give those voters a bit more weight to make sure their sample looks, demographically, more like the United States. But other adjustments — such as determining who is a ""likely voter"" — are more difficult, and incorrect calculations can lead to a pollster missing voters who cast a ballot.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-07-22	The Washington Post (Online)	Polling is broken. No one knows how to fix it.	txt-opeds/2554150809.xml.txt	Of the top three culprits, nonresponse is the most likely suspect. As pollster David Hill wrote in a Post op-ed in November, ""To complete 1,510 interviews over several weeks, we had to call 136,688 voters. In hard-to-interview Florida, only 1 in 90-odd voters would speak with our interviewers."" That ratio of nonresponsive citizens is what Hill called polling's ""dirty little secret."" More distressingly, there is no easy way to solve for these shortcomings. If a group of people refuses to pick up the phone, there's little pollsters can do about that. No one can control whether an election has high or low turnout. And many pollsters are already making a good-faith effort to use sound statistical methods.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-07-22	The Washington Post (Online)	Polling is broken. No one knows how to fix it.	txt-opeds/2554150809.xml.txt	Complicating the calculations: We live in an era of close races. Trump was only 45,000 votes short of winning the electoral college in 2020; Hillary Clinton was only 77,000 votes short in 2016. These are tiny percentages of the total vote, far below the margin of error. But in contests this close, the smallest error — even the random, unavoidable noise inherent in survey research — could cause a poll to ""call"" a race incorrectly. Nor will fixing these problems solve polling's larger credibility issues. Candidates who are losing an election will always attack the polls as flawed, or worse, and some voters will take their word for it. Polling might never be free of ""correlated errors"" — where pollsters make the same mistake in multiple states, causing one party to be underestimated across the nation. And artifacts of random chance — such as polls that underestimate Republicans in three of the past four elections — can easily be mistaken for partisan bias.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

A permanent wealth tax was raised last April in a Times Op-Ed essay by the Yale professor Daniel Markovits. It still sounds logical nine months into the pandemic: “The precise contours of such a tax obviously require detailed design. Still, a rough outline illustrates the basic idea. The wealthiest 5 percent of American families now hold $57 trillion, or two-thirds of all household wealth in the country (up from about half in 1960). An exemption for the first $2.5 million of household wealth would exclude the bottom 95 percent from paying any tax at all and leave the top 5 percent with total taxable wealth of roughly $40 trillion.

Again and again, they push policies meant to affect politics, such as campaign-finance deregulation, voting restrictions and labor-union constraints. Republicans understand a concept that political scientists refer to as “policy feedback” — namely, that policy can influence politics in ways that make future policy changes more or less likely.

Lower-income families sign up for the earned-income tax credit by visiting a tax-preparation company, which can make the benefit appear to come from H&R Block, rather than Uncle Sam. The Obama stimulus remains the canonical example. Out of a well-intended desire to get Americans to spend more of their stimulus tax cut, the administration snuck the money into people’s paychecks, rather than sending one-time checks (as George W.

Salzman is a professor at UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and at UCLA Law School. Over the past pandemic year, American billionaires have grown $1.3 trillion richer, the beneficiaries of a soaring stock market. Income inequality has widened. One response is imposing new taxes on wealth, such as those just introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), but that approach faces significant political hurdles. There's another way to tackle the problem. Instead of focusing only on taxing wealth accumulation, we can address the hidden flip side — wealth transmission. America's super-rich have created a little-known parallel legal system in some unlikely states. There, they pass on massive amounts of wealth tax-free and lock in inequality for generations, exploiting cracks in our system of taxing inherited wealth.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

The place to start is South Dakota, which has quietly made itself the world's leading money haven, crushing former go-to shelters such as Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. In theory, the super-wealthy pay some taxes when they pass on estates beyond the current tax-free exemption level of $11.7 million for an individual, $23.4 million per couple. But the reality is that the wealthy find legal ways to shelter their enormous estates using tax avoidance tools that understate their assets' true values.

In total, these estates will pay perhaps $16 billion — roughly a 2 percent average tax rate on America's inherited income, one-seventh the average tax rate on income from work and savings. How is this possible? Enter South Dakota. The state has created a bespoke legal system for America's richest families, with wealth-sheltering tools including the aptly named ""dynasty trust."" In 1983, the state adopted a 19-word law that effectively abolished the ""rule against perpetuities,"" an ancient, obscure rule that had one salutary effect: It kept families from locking up wealth perpetually.

America's ultra-wealthy have pulled off a brilliantly designed heist, with a string of South Dakota governors as accomplices.

And by hyper-concentrating wealth, South Dakota locks away resources that could spark entrepreneurial innovation. All this is possible because, in the United States, states mostly define family ownership, not the federal government. Effectively, South Dakota is setting national policy. But Congress can override these choices and plug holes in our leaky estate tax system. One step would be to tax trusts at the passage of each generation and limit generation-skipping tax-exempt trusts. A bigger step would be to ensure that appreciated stocks — a big driver of wealth inequality — are taxed at least once.

(Morneau has lasted closer to five years than the eight years his comment implies). On the face of it, the former finance minister's account strains credulity. After days of stories trailing leaked information — presumably from the prime minister's office or those adjacent to it — about tensions between Trudeau and Morneau, it seems unlikely that the latter elected, as a first choice, to resign as finance minister of a Group of Seven country during a crisis to angle for a move to the OECD.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Or was it difficulty working with the prime minister, including substantive policy clashes? It's a whole rich, rotten tapestry. But is the country better off for it anyway, either now or later?

Those measures could include a wealth tax, a plan to tackle big tax dodgers, higher taxes for just about everyone, universal pharmacare, universal child care, ambitious green infrastructure, programming to encourage worker-owned enterprises or a basic income. For his part, in the same news conference, Trudeau ruled out any new taxes after announcing his plans to prorogue Parliament, shutting down, among other things, committee investigation work into the WE scandal until Sept. 23 (something Trudeau criticized his former opponent, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper for doing).	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

It’s not only that he was chosen to host “Saturday Night Live” on May 8 or that there was another fatal crash under suspicious circumstances of a car made by his company, Tesla, but also a surge in his charitable spending. In just the first four months of this year, Vox.com reports, Musk has donated $150 million to philanthropic causes. That sounds like a lot of money. Vox calls it a “philanthropic spending spree.” It’s wonderful that Mr. Musk is giving away some of his wealth, but apple pie is also great and so is calling your mother on her birthday...But none of those things excuse us from our obligations to pay our fair share of taxes.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

One could interpret it as marking Elon Musk as one of the world’s outstanding cheapskates. That’s because, as a proportion of Musk’s total net worth, which was estimated by Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index as $187 billion on Sunday, $150 million is about eight-hundredths of a percent, or comparatively less than pennies. I can’t be entirely sure of this, but I believe I’ve witnessed commuters fork over a larger proportion of their net worth to panhandlers on the subway. For another metric, consider that if Musk continued giving away his fortune at this rate, say $600 million a year, it would take him 311 years to give it all away.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Musk may have given away more money but anonymously. Also, Musk’s fortune rises and ebbs with the value of Tesla stock, which is his major asset. (He owns about 20% of the company.) The billionaires who funded Trump’s politics got their money’s worth. As I write, the shares are worth about $736 each; a year ago, they were worth closer to $160 and Bloomberg estimated his fortune at about $40 billion. The Musk Foundation, which appears to be his one public instrument for philanthropy, reports its income and outflow every year, but its latest public report only covers the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019.

The result is a system that cedes decisions about which social maladies should be addressed and how to self-interested billionaires, rather than to the community as a whole. “It’s wonderful that Mr. Musk is giving away some of his wealth, but apple pie is also great and so is calling your mother on her birthday,” says Morris Pearl, a former investment executive who now heads Patriotic Millionaires, an organization of high-net-worth individuals advocating for “a highly progressive tax system, a livable minimum wage, and equal political representation for all citizens.”	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Residents of his new home state no doubt welcomed the help, but it points to the question of why a state should be so incapable of feeding its poorest citizens that a private organization has to sponsor food banks and reach out to an individual to do so.

Signatories include the investor George Soros, Berkshire Hathaway scion Molly Munger, Mickey Mouse heiress Abigail Disney, Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, and a couple of Hyatt Hotel progeny from the Pritzker family. ""America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more,"" they say. Revenue squeezed from the top 0.1% could fund ""smart investments,"" such as ""clean energy innovation,"" ""infrastructure modernization,"" ""student loan debt relief,"" and ""public health solutions."" A wealth tax could safeguard democracy, too, since countries with high economic inequality are more likely to ""become plutocratic.""	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Would courts find it unconstitutional? How would assets like Picassos be valued? Why has Europe largely abandoned this kind of taxation? Doesn't it diminish the incentive to save and invest? What's to keep a wealth tax from expanding, like the income tax did, to cover more and more Americans? Instead of seriously grappling with these objections, the letter tries to sweep readers along in sheer patriotic fervor. The rich ""should be proud to pay a bit more,"" the authors say. ""Taking on this tax is the least we can do to strengthen the country we love.""	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

If billionaires see themselves as a threat to ""the stability and integrity of our republic,"" they could cease being billionaires any day. If retiring student debt is vital, they could put out a call to graduates and start paying off loans. If the climate is a priority, they could fund a green Manhattan Project. Maybe they're intent on routing their largesse through the government, since it already does such a bang-up job of setting priorities and spending prudently. Again, though, why wait for legislation? They could start contributing more today. First, they could pledge to forgo all tax write-offs, including on charitable donations and foundations. As a side benefit, this would save them money on accountants.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The Treasury accepts "" Gifts to the United States "" at P.O. Box 1328, Parkersburg, W.Va. Donations usually go to the general budget, but state policies differ, and maybe an exception could be made to let benevolent billionaires specify an earmark in the ""memo"" line. A few ideas: • California's bullet train is stalled, which hurts everybody who will need to get to Fresno in a hurry sometime after 2025. The Trump Administration is trying to claw back $2.5 billion in federal funds, and these 19 generous donors could easily fill that gap.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

That's surely ""infrastructure modernization,"" as anyone who's sniffed Penn Station can attest. The funding is in limbo, and billionaires could rescue the project. Heck, build a new Penn Station and put a Hyatt on top. • The New York City Housing Authority could use a bailout. In a recent Nycha upgrade, switching public-housing lights and fixtures to efficient LEDs cost $1,973 per apartment . Since Nycha has 170,000 units, doing the whole works at that rate would cost a mere $330 million. • Public pensions are underwater everywhere, but Illinois's are swimming the Marianas Trench. As of February the state pension debt was $134 billion. Perhaps the Pritzker clan could pitch in, especially since one of their own sits in the Illinois Governor's mansion.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

The point is that if they think government will perform more good with more funds, they should put up the cash now, without waiting for Congress to make them. If a wealth tax is patriotic, a self-imposed one would be doubly so. ""It is not in our interest to advocate for this tax,"" the letter says, ""if our interests are quite narrowly understood. But the wealth tax is in our interest as Americans."" In that case, billionaire, tax thyself.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Is Deval Patrick simply too far behind the pack? The former Massachusetts governor, who joined the Democratic primary field only in mid-November, swatted back any such worry as he made the case for his candidacy before the Times editorial board [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] on Dec. 12. Mr. Patrick argued that the path to the nomination was still wide open, especially for a contender with his particular experience in business and government. Time will tell. Mr. Patrick, only the country’s second black elected governor, spoke about race in America today, trying to reduce the cost of public education and what the nation can learn from “PatrickCare.” Less fleshed out were his foreign policy views, and he struggled to address some of the more contentious episodes of his governorship.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

We’re down at zero. [Mr. Patrick entered the race late, on Nov. 14. He has consistently polled at around 0 percent, according to FiveThirtyEight.] So what is that made you look at the field and go, “I really need to jump in”? DP: I was looking more at the country than at the field. I thought, I have felt for some while, deep gratitude for my own American journey, coming from poverty to … I’ve had the range of life and leadership experiences that I’ve had, and I have been concerned about the accessibility of that dream for fewer and fewer people in more and more places. And I think it was true, you know, when I first left the South Side of Chicago at 14 in 1970, and I think it is a deeper concern and ought to be for all of us, because I think the American dream is defining and worth fighting for.

Some of you may know this, but we were two or three weeks from an announcement. We had a whole rollout plan and everything, and my wife was diagnosed with uterine cancer. That’s the sort of thing that just brings your feet back to earth. We paid attention to her and to that. I was just saying outside that when we celebrated 35 years of marriage in May, she was cancer free. [In late 2018, Mr. Patrick announced that he would not enter the presidential race and disclosed that his wife had been diagnosed with Stage 1 uterine cancer. He said she had undergone surgery and had a good prognosis.] She’s doing great, she’s fired up. I continued to watch the field as it was evolving, and I have a lot of friends in the field and I’ve been talking to them throughout their campaigns. But it’s still true, and I say it as humbly as a candidate can, there isn’t anyone with the range of life and leadership experiences that I have had in the field with the problem solving experiences I have had in government, in the private sector, here in the United States and overseas.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Not to make the agenda any less ambitious, but to get solutions that are the success points and bragging points for a whole lot of people. You have to make space for people, including folks who may not agree with you. This is a moment where we can’t miss, beyond replacing the incumbent president, the willingness of people to invest in their own aspirations in our government, I think is right on the edge.

No, I’m not going to talk about the substance or too much of the substance of our conversations because that’s why we get to keep having these conversations. I will say this, though. I talked to him a lot before I was ready to go the last time, and really just a little when I had made a decision to get in, so close to the time I was ready to announce. He was very balanced and he talks to everybody. He talks to all of the candidates, you probably know. [President Obama has not endorsed a Democrat in the primary race, staying notably mum on his former vice president, Joe Biden. He has said that Democrats should not focus so much on the “tactical disagreements” among the candidates, and should “chill out about the candidates, but gin up about the prospect of rallying behind” the nominee.]	5	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

DP: Well, some of what I said, I think that we are a very divided country. We were divided, in my opinion, before President Trump was elected. I think the one truth he spoke in 2016 is that conventional or establishment politics wasn’t working very well for most people. I think that’s the same truth that Senator Sanders spoke. I think it’s the same truth that Barack Obama spoke a decade and a half before. And I think it is still true. So to the extent that we — and I very much believe we need to ask people to re-engage in their own civic and political future — that we in a democracy get the government we deserve. And we didn’t have to actually deliver on the stuff we’re talking about. A lot of the policy choices, particularly in reforms that other candidates have talked about, we’ve done in Massachusetts.

DP: Well, I think there are a lot of reasons. I think frankly he healed more division than we give him credit for. Do you remember … correct me on this, I think I’m right in remembering, that Leader McConnell made his comment about the No. 1 objective being making Obama a one-term president before the inauguration. [In an interview with National Journal in October 2010, the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said: “The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.”] I think I’m right about that.	7	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

We were in the midst of a financial crisis. The bottom was falling out of the global economy. And that’s [Mr. McConnell’s] answer at a time of national crisis. And it made me think it might be that the other side appreciated the significance of this moment better than we did. Because the moment we were celebrating, a lot of folks were celebrating, was that United States had elected its first African-American president. I think what Leader McConnell recognized is that we had just elected a bridge builder, and that for them to drive their agenda, they needed to make sure that bridge was burned as early as possible.	8	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

[In defending his late entry to the race, Mr. Patrick said the rest of the field was either too focused on nostalgia or big ideas and “neither of those, it seems to me, seizes the moment to pull the nation together.”] So unpack that a little bit for me.

I can talk about my campaign. MC: It’s why you got in, to some degree. DP: It’s not all of why I got in. I was thinking about getting in before the others got in. So don’t forget what I said earlier. And I still think frankly the path I thought was there, when we resolved in November to go ahead, is wider than I thought it was. We’ve had candidates spend a lot of time and a lot of money in the early states, and it’s not settled. And the polls tell part of the picture, but they don’t really tell yet.

KK: We’ve had the advantage of seeing most of the other candidates on a debate stage at this point. Can we just run through what seemed to be the biggest talking points in the campaign? DP: You’re going to ask me to raise my hand? KK: No, but could you give us the one- to two-sentence answer for what seemed to be the issues that are getting traction? Do you support “Medicare for all”? DP: Medicare for all is a slogan we’ve been using for a whole bunch of different things. What I support is a public option. Whether that public option is Medicare or not, I’m totally open to that. But the point is to get health care to everybody that is affordable. I don’t support eliminating the private insurance industry, and it’s not because I have any particular fondness for the private insurance industry. [Mr. Patrick served on the board of American Well Corporation, a telemedicine company, as well as the pharmaceutical firm Global Blood Therapeutics. Read The Wall Street Journal’s examination of his ties to the health care industry here.] It’s just I think you get a creative tension in having private insurance having to figure out how to compete with a lower-cost alternative that is publicly paid for, and you get some innovation on the Medicare side, where CMS is going to have to think about how to make its offerings, its quality, comparable and as broad as the private insurance industry.

2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Deval Patrick Says the Race Is Just Getting Started	txt-opeds/2339459723.xml.txt	We as citizens, I think, are hungry for innovation in public policy in the same way we see it in the private sector. But if you want successful innovation, the environment has to tolerate failure. But politics punishes failure. So we get less innovation than we’d like. On health care, I know you said one or two sentences, but just can I say a word more? KK: It’s okay. Please. I’ve got a long list. DP: I got time. I got time. So in Massachusetts, we had a broad coalition of policymakers, providers, patient advocates, interfaith leaders, all kinds of folks who came together to invent health care reform and then stuck together because we kept learning things. Governor Romney signed the bill. It took effect the day I took office. We should call it PatrickCare, by the way, not RomneyCare. And we got to 98.5 percent insured in short order. [RomneyCare is the name given to Gov. Mitt Romney’s health care reform laws passed in Massachusetts in 2006. It was used as a model for the Affordable Care Act, and it is believed that about 97.2 percent of people in the state are insured because of the law.

Why? Because we kept learning things and we kept trying to improve on the strength of what we learned. And that’s what it’s going to have to be like at the federal. [Mr. Patrick signed major health care reform bills that capped annual growth in health care costs to the state’s gross domestic product and imposed surcharges on insurers and providers to fund the costs of reform.

[Senator Sanders, Senator Warren and Mr. Steyer have been vocal proponents of a wealth tax. Mayor Buttigieg said he is open to the idea; Senator Klobuchar calls it unrealistic.] DP: Well, my answer is that’s not the answer from my perspective, mostly because I don’t think wealth is the issue. [In late December, Mr. Patrick said he opposes a wealth tax because it has been tried in other places and proved unsuccessful.] It’s greed. I do think we need massive simplification of the individual or the personal income tax system. We ought to treat all income as income. We have to just make it a lot simpler. On the corporate side, even the business communities didn’t want the rates to go that low. So I think those rates probably need to go up by as much as four or five points.	14	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

So that work is unfinished. What is attractive to me about thinking about the frame of a wealth tax, is to think about it as a one-time assessment against things like bringing the deficit down, eliminating student debt. As a practical matter on an ongoing basis, I’m not quite sure it works. But you know what? You have to acknowledge the frustration and resentment that a lot of people feel about where we are and how we got here. And that’s to my point about greed.	15	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

It was about, “Here’s the stuff you have to do to get to be that.” The things you had to do and the rules you had to abide by to be that have all been compromised in my time. There’s a whole lot we can do around that. And that’s what our opportunity agenda is about. You’ll hear more about that. It’s about investing in education, in innovation, which is a strategy, a movement, a representation of how the economy, the knowledge based economy is becoming and how we can own it as a nation instead of being afraid of it, and infrastructure, which is the unglamorous work that government does that enables all the rest.	16	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

DP: I think that public colleges and universities should be much, much more affordable. By the way, from my experience in Massachusetts, that has to do with the public coming out of public college and university. We tried to get to a 50/50 contribution in exchange for freezes. We didn’t get much further than that, and I think it slipped back in the years since. But one of the things I’m interested in is this notion of national service, what General McChrystal has been working on and has proposed, and that I’ve co-chaired with him for a whole lot of other reasons. [Along with Gen. Stanley McChrystal and four others, Mr. Patrick is a co-chair of the campaign Serve America Together, which calls for federal legislation creating a universal national service program. ] But alongside that, I love the idea of having a year or two of tuition relief in exchange for your time contributing to the common good.	17	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

She knew the job more intimately than many others, but it was one of those things where at some point the agency, the folks on the ground had lost confidence in her.

The reason I left business for government is that the bad habit I’ve seen in business of this quarter-to-quarter, short-term focus, sometimes I think at the expense of the long-term interests of the enterprise is crept into the way we govern ourselves. We govern ourselves from election cycle to election cycle, news cycle to news cycle and not generation to generation. It is true nationally today as it was true in Massachusetts then that there were a few hard decisions we needed to make in our time to leave things better for those who came behind us.

My question, my next question was going to be: You said earlier you tried to build bridges, you certainly did some of that in Massachusetts, but actually some of the biggest challenges you had came from the all-Democrat Legislature [Mr. Patrick faced immense pushback from Democratic state legislators, particularly over his attempts to veto transportation measures. Something many of the candidates struggled to address, in conversations with the editorial board, was their intended approach to working with an obstructionist McConnell-led Senate.] and I’m curious how that informs how you would handle Mitch McConnell’s Senate, for instance?

So I said I would end it. So, the legislature wanted to raise the sales tax. I have these three reform bills pending and I said, “Look, if you give me the reform bills in the form I’ve asked for them, I will do the sales tax.” Everybody on my team said, “You can’t do that. You won’t get re-elected,” and we did it anyway and the first ad we did in the re-election was about raising taxes, which the consultant nearly quit over, but I said, “Look, this is about investing in schools. If you’re in the second grade, you don’t get to sit out the second grade until the recession is over. Right now is your time. Right now.” What is generational responsibility if not making those decisions right now that make things better for those who come behind you. Just like before folks said, “Well, he’s not going to win,” and we did. [Mr. Patrick’s 2010 re-election was a hard-won victory, with pundits predicting he would win by a slim margin. His approval rating had suffered a sharp decline, particularly given his frequent clashes with the Legislature. In his victory speech, he said he was committed to healing the partisan divide and ensuring he was not just “the governor of the Democrats.” Read The Times’s account here.]	57	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It’s not just about accumulating political capital, but spending it when you have to. The Legislature in Massachusetts, as you said, is overwhelmingly Democratic. The dynamic at home is less Democratic-Republican than insider-outsider, right? Yeah and it’s a pretty tight, inward-looking political dynamic. I was an unwelcome entrant when I started the campaign, and for 16 years before the legislative leadership had Republican governors and as one of them described it to me, when the governor would submit his or her budget, they’d take the budget and say, “Thank you very much,” and toss it into the fireplace.

Then we get all wound up when the commas were all rearranged, and there were other ways of accomplishing. We got the goal, which was not the bill, but what the bill was trying to do, right? But there were other ways of thinking about how to get there that had to be accommodated in order to get it done and so, I think what I learned was the importance of being real clear about the objectives and also a willingness to use sharp elbows, but without embarrassing people publicly. By the way, leader McConnell plays a completely different game, and I do think that there is work that I would be eager to do as a candidate and as a nominee and as president alongside candidates for the Senate because we do need a Senate that is willing to work with the White House.	59	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Officials at the board tried to overturn this decision and were unsuccessful.

Governor Baker also granted no pardons in his first three years in office, despite nearly 200 requests for executive clemency.] How would you approach the job as president with the clemency power being one of the most unfettered powers that a president has? DP: Yeah, the clemency power of a governor in Massachusetts is not unfettered. You have to get a clearance of the governor’s council, which is an independently elected body, and it’s not that easy to do. [Petitions for clemency are first submitted to the Parole Board, which conducts an investigation and public hearing before making a recommendation to the governor. The Massachusetts Constitution stipulates that a grant of clemency relies on the advice and consent of the Governor’s Council, composed of eight individuals elected from districts and the lieutenant governor serving ex officio.] One of the things we looked at that I’m very intrigued by from the president’s perspective is commuting the sentences of people who have been convicted of nonviolent drug offenses.

I’ll come back to the source of the T’s failure to invest over time, but I said, “Look, tell me now what’s off the table,” because we have but so many levers. We know we need new revenue, and we [had] done the transportation reform, which created hundreds of millions of dollars of savings, which we could reinvest in transportation and it was being reinvested in transportation, but there was going to be no amount of reorganization that would get us a 21st-century T, for example.	72	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

And by infrastructure, I don’t just mean transportation infrastructure, although you are asking about Gateway. It’s broadband access, it’s updating our underground infrastructure, water, and sewer. It’s distributed generation of electricity, which is a security issue as well as a modernization issue, and there are ways to do this that can involve, not in every case, but can involve public-private partnerships.

DP: I was co-chair of that campaign, and I remember I was with some other folks from that campaign the other day talking about how they’d done too good a job. [Mr. Patrick was co-chair of the Obama-Biden campaign in 2012, and when asked about the campaign’s attacks on Mr. Romney’s record at Bain Capital, Mr. Patrick said, “I didn’t buy it then, and I don’t buy it now.”] Look, my work at Bain Capital was to found a business that invested in businesses for social and environmental impact and to demonstrate, through that, that it was a false choice all along to say you had to trade return for that kind of measurable impact. Examples are a company in Texas that diverts green waste from landfills, where it would otherwise break down and turn it into methane, and instead recycles it and sells it as composted soil and ground cover. Or another company that delivers health care to poor kids. Excuse me. Dental health care to poor kids, which has been a huge challenge.

Realistically speaking, the capital of Israel has been Jerusalem for a long time, but I think the business of tolerating and, in fact, encouraging the settlements as someone who believes in a two-state solution, seems to me to be completely counterproductive, and to make harder what Israel says it wants, which is both a democratic and a Jewish state, and without a two-state solution, I’m not sure you get there.

By the way, the interrelationship between that — First of all, Israel is an incredibly important democracy and partner of ours in the region and will always be if I’m president.

This is why.	txt-opeds/2561144883.xml.txt	Political observers of Canada's 43rd Parliament have been working through the five stages of election grief. Denial: There won't be an election. Anger: I can't believe there's going to be an election. Bargaining: Maybe we can persuade the prime minister not to call the election or the governor general to refuse his request for one. After Sunday's likely announcement, it will be depression as the election begins, followed by acceptance: The election is happening, and someone is going to form or maintain government. We should make the acceptance stage work for us. The country's 44th general election is unnecessary right now. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has been doing his best to make the case that Parliament is dysfunctional and toxic, laying the groundwork to justify sending Canadians to the polls during a pandemic. In fact, during this minority government, Parliament has been inclined to keep the governing side accountable and to participate in shaping the policy agenda. Moreover, Trudeau maintains the confidence of the House of Commons and thus the right to govern. But the Liberals know this moment may be their best chance to secure a majority government before the vicissitudes of the fall and winter — and another coronavirus variant — change the political landscape.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Rarely is an election ""about"" any particular issue, with some notable exceptions, such as the 1988 federal election dominated by free trade. This election is likely to be focused, in part, on the government's pandemic response and competing visions for a pandemic recovery. How much should we spend? Where should we spend it? For how long? The design of Canada's pandemic recovery plan will decide, as Harold Lasswell would put it, who gets what, when and how. The plan will determine not just the distribution of resources but also the distribution of capacities and opportunities — of power; if we get it wrong, we risk unnecessary suffering and the further entrenchment of the powerful.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

A national child-care program that guarantees affordable spaces for parents would be transformational and, as economist Armine Yalnizyan argues, necessary to support women in the workforce, especially in the aftermath of the pandemic. The Liberals are using it as an incentive to secure votes, but it remains a welcome program either way.

Accountability and justice in the face of crimes committed at residential schools must also be addressed, including structural reforms — including land back — that rebalance power relations between settlers in Canada and Indigenous peoples. Anti-Black racism ought to be on the election agenda as well. The issue is widespread. As CBC reporter David Thurton reports, in the wake of George Floyd's murder Trudeau promised to consider the calls to action presented to him by the Parliamentary Black Caucus. Over a year later, Thurton finds that the federal government ""has made progress on 24 out of 44 calls to action."" A small number of measures have been implemented; but as Hill Times columnist Erica Ifill argues, reforms must go deeper to include police reform federally and provincially.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

They'll be one this time, too. The New Democratic Party is once again pushing for a wealth tax, and Canadians support the idea. As the pandemic has further exposed structural inequality, the idea has a chance to find its way toward implementation, and it should. Wireless and broadband affordability will also be an issue once again. Canada's wireless rates are absurd, and broadband is no better. Affordable access to cellular and high-speed Internet service across the country is critical. In 2019, the Liberals promised to lower prices. They failed.

A related proposal would create a digital safety commissioner and penalties to address illegal content online. The country needs to have a deep conversation about how Internet content ought to be regulated. Now's the time. Just before the House of Commons rose, Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion Carla Qualtrough introduced legislation for a new disability benefit. As Accessibility for All founder Meenu Sikand writes, ""Many of us in the disability community are equal parts optimistic and skeptical about the proposed benefit: we know there's little possibility such legislation will pass before a likely fall election.""

It's a pressing existential issue as we stare down a tipping point and a near-majority of Canadians are ready for ""urgent"" action to manage the threat in the face of extreme weather events. Our pandemic focus has taken some attention from climate action. Canada continues to underperform on climate relative to what must be done. It's beyond time to talk about big, aggressive ideas to address climate change, both mitigation and adaptation. As we reach the acceptance stage of the election, we should leverage the moment to revisit issues and reprioritize as we reflect on the past two years.

The other half of the package — how to pay for these investments — is equally important. The already huge gap between the 0.1 percent and everyone else is just getting wider. Billionaire wealth surged by $1.8 trillion from the early days of the pandemic through last month. The 400 richest Americans had more total wealth, as of 2019, than all 10 million Black American households, plus a quarter of Latino households, combined. Yet the ultrarich pay only 3.2 percent of that wealth in taxes, while 99 percent of families pay 7.2 percent. And scores of giant U.S. corporations pay zero.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-08-12	The Washington Post (Online)	How to fix our rigged tax system	txt-opeds/2560495484.xml.txt	I've proposed measures that would raise more than $5 trillion in revenue — far more than we need to enact the Biden plan. Though not every Democrat agrees with every one of my ideas, Biden campaigned aggressively on a suite of progressive tax policies, and voters embraced these changes at the ballot box. No matter how loudly Washington lobbyists bleat otherwise, progressive tax policies are wildly popular. Americans understand that our tax system has been rigged to reward the rich and powerful at the expense of everyone else. So let's fix it. First, it's time to start taxing wealth, not just income. When Jeff Bezos takes a joyride to space, he isn't paying for it with his declared income of $80,000. Bezos, who owns The Post, and lots of other billionaires have gamed the system so they have plenty of spending money and close to zero tax obligations. The best option to stop that is a two-cent wealth tax that applies only to the wealthiest 100,000 U.S. households — with a few cents more for the billionaires. Such a wealth tax would raise roughly $3 trillion in revenue over the next decade, without raising taxes on 99.95 percent of Americans. It's supported by 68 percent of the country, including a majority of Republicans. And there are lots of ways to advance this principle — including a one-time wealth tax that would raise over $1 trillion.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

In the three years following the 2017 Republican tax cuts, 39 megacorporations, including Amazon and FedEx, reported more than $122 billion in profits to their shareholders while using loopholes, deductions and exemptions to pay zero in federal income taxes. These companies boosted their stock prices and increased CEO pay by telling their shareholders they raked in hundreds of millions of dollars in profits, while simultaneously telling the Internal Revenue Service that they don't owe any taxes. The president supports taxing the profits that large companies report to their shareholders. Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) and I have a plan that mirrors his. We would require any company that earns more than $100 million in profits to pay a 7 percent tax on every dollar earned above that amount. Only about 1,300 public companies would pay the tax, raising nearly $700 billion over 10 years.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Currently, the top 1 percent of Americans fail to report more than a fifth of their income. The difference between taxes owed and taxes actually paid exceeds an estimated $1 trillion annually. The superrich get away with not paying their taxes because decades of politically motivated budget cuts have hollowed out the IRS. Since 2010, the agency's enforcement budget has declined by more than 20 percent, and it has lost one-third of its enforcers. It's no surprise that audit rates for taxpayers making more than $10 million have plummeted. This should enrage every American who plays by the rules. That's why over 70 percent of Americans support giving the IRS more resources to make sure the wealthy and corporations aren't evading taxes.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

I've suggested a step further: $31.5 billion in permanent annual funding to track down wealthy and corporate tax cheats. The IRS also needs better reporting from banks and other financial institutions so it can sniff out the hidden cash of the ultrarich. These changes could raise as much as $1.75 trillion from tax cheats. I've put these three proposals — a wealth tax, a tax on real corporate profits and closing the tax gap — on the table. There are other ideas worthy of consideration, but the standard should be writing rules that target wealthy freeloaders and corporate grifters and then enforcing those rules. American workers and families don't want handouts. They want everybody to play by the same rules. The Democrats' infrastructure plan is about investments and tax fairness — changes that would help build a strong future for not only a handful of people at the top but for everyone.

2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	My indefatigable co-blogger has already said most of what needs to be said about the folly of Howard Schultz's embryonic third-party presidential candidacy. The idea that a billionaire with no political experience is just what we need is particularly galling amid our current disastrous experiment. And Schultz would run as a ""centrist independent,"" which appears to mean ""economically conservative and socially liberal,"" but there's not a great constituency for that. I'd like to add an additional point about Schultz's independent centrism. In its current form, it totally fails to achieve anything resembling the realistic middle ground between unrealistic extremes that he keeps claiming to inhabit.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	NPR aired an interview with Schultz on Tuesday, during which the billionaire elaborated on his views on economic and tax policy. Schultz reiterated that he believes we must reduce economic inequality. But, strikingly, Schultz — who constantly talks about the need to tackle the deficit — refused to say directly whether under his agenda, the wealthy would have to pay more in taxes. First, NPR's Steve Inskeep asked Schultz this question: Inskeep: President [Barack] Obama's theory was that you reduce the deficit in small measure by raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans. President Trump's theory was that you reduce the deficit by cutting taxes on the wealthiest Americans. You're smiling. Which of either of those is true?	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	Schultz declined to answer directly, instead saying: ""We are in dire need of comprehensive tax reform, which would include a significant level of infrastructure development."" Schultz did reiterate that he opposed the massive corporate tax cut passed in 2017 by the GOP Congress and signed by Trump. But then this exchange happened, according to a full transcript of the interview that NPR provided to me: Inskeep: So if you're a president that may be going back up. Schultz: I think what I would I rather say is that comprehensive tax reform would not have included a 21 percent tax rate for corporations.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	Inskeep: Is it safe to say that the wealthiest would have to pay more? Whatever the rates become? However the reform is structured? Schultz: What I would say is that we need comprehensive tax reform. These are remarkable exchanges. Schultz refused to say whether he thinks the notion that massive high-end tax cuts pay for themselves has been discredited — which is particularly indefensible given the soaring deficits after the Trump tax cuts. Nor would Schultz say whether paying down the deficit by raising taxes on the wealthy is more economically legitimate. And he refused to answer whether under his vision, the wealthy would pay more.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	Yet in the very next breath, Schultz also attacked Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) new proposal for a wealth tax — on household wealth over $50 million — as ""ridiculous"" and ""punitive"" and ""not something that's ever going to be passed."" As Paul Krugman points out, whether or not one supports Warren's proposal, it's notable that tax experts are taking it seriously, because it treats extreme wealth concentration at the very top, revenue shortfalls (and their resulting social ills), and extreme inequality as legitimately profound challenges that require progressive tax reform ambitious enough to match the scale of those problems.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	In this sense, what Warren has offered is plainly more realistic as policy than what Schultz is offering here. Keep in mind that Schultz himself claims to want to address the latter two of those problems (though whether he wants to address the first one appears rather less clear). Schultz would not have backed cuts to corporate tax rates as deep as Trump's, but this probably means he would back cutting them by less, and he won't say whether he'd want the wealthy's overall tax burden to go up relative to the status quo. Schultz probably doesn't believe cutting taxes on the wealthy is the way to combat deficits. But during another part of the NPR interview, Schultz was asked what painful measures he'd accept for tackling trillion-dollar deficits, and this happened: Inskeep: You've got trillion dollar annual deficits now in good times. Getting that down calls for some specific painful sounding things. . . . Changes to Medicare and Social Security. Tax increases on somebody . . . Are you going to do that?	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	Schultz: Well you haven't talked about growth. Inskeep: So you think you can grow your way out of a trillion-dollar deficit? Schultz: I don't think you can grow your way out of a trillion dollars. It's good that Schultz admitted that we can't solve trillion-dollar deficits only with economic growth, but does that immediate segue to growth as the solution to deficits scream hard-headed realism to you? It's even worse than this. Schultz says he wants to reduce poverty. But he also wants to reduce deficits while also cutting taxes on the middle class, and he won't say how big a role in deficit-reduction bringing in more revenue from the spectacularly wealthy should play, which, if negligible, would make it harder to fund poverty-reduction programs. And at any rate he wants to tackle the deficit by cutting entitlements, which might also compromise such efforts. As Eric Levitz points out, this amounts to a big bundle of incoherence: Schultz is promising to reduce inequality by keeping taxes on corporate shareholders lower than they were under Obama, to reduce the deficit by slashing taxes on the middle class, and to end poverty by cutting two of the most effective anti-poverty programs in American history.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	On top of this, Schultz was also asked by NPR whether he would support combating inequality through corporate governance reform. Warren has offered such a proposal, which would mandate worker representation on boards of billion-dollar corporations and require them to obtain federal charters instructing them to factor the interests of all stakeholders, including workers and communities. The goal is to reestablish an ethic of social responsibility to combat the culture of ""shareholder supremacy"" that has helped produce extreme wealth concentrations at the top. Schultz conceded to NPR that shareholder supremacy is a serious problem, and he has acted out that view as a CEO. But he also said, ""I don't think I would be changing laws"" to address it, instead vowing to persuade CEOs to accept a ""moral obligation and responsibility"" to do ""more"" for ""employees and the communities we serve."" Again, whether or not you support Warren's proposal, it is more grounded as policy than this airy solution, which also doesn't sound terribly realistic.	7	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-01-29	The Washington Post (Online)	Howard Schultz is anything but a realist	txt-opeds/2173396707.xml.txt	At the core of this sort of centrism is the idea that there's a hallowed middle ground that — simply by virtue of being equidistant between arbitrarily designated and presumptively equivalent ""extremes"" — is inherently sensible, virtuous, and above all, non-ideological.

Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	Imagine for a moment that a presidential candidate made this speech: My fellow Americans, I’m here today to tell you about my economic plan. Each year, I will require every middle-class family across this great country to write a check. We will then pool the money and distribute it to the richest Americans among us — the top 1 percent of earners, who, because of their talent, virtue and success, deserve even more money. The exact size of the checks will depend on a family’s income, but a typical middle-class household will hand over $15,000 each year. This plan, I promise all of you, will create the greatest version of America that has ever existed.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Destructive, even. Well, I’ve just described the actual changes in the American economy since the 1970s. [ Sign up for David Leonhardt’s daily newsletter — with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web. ] Economic output — known as G.D.P. — per person has almost doubled over this period. But the bulk of the bounty has flowed to the very rich. The middle class has received relative crumbs. If middle-class pay had increased as fast as the economic growth, the average middle-class family would today earn about $15,000 a year more than it does, after taxes and benefits. Instead, that middle-class family effectively forfeits the money to the rich, year after year after year.

Some of them, like technological change, stem mostly from private-sector forces. But government policy plays a crucial role. Tax rates on the wealthy have fallen sharply . Labor unions have been undermined . Big companies have been allowed to grow even bigger and more powerful. The United States has lost its lead as the most educated country in the world. More often than not over the past 40 years, our government has helped the rich at the expense of everyone else. As a result, economic inequality has reached Gilded Age levels.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	In the face of these trends, the radical response is to do nothing — or to make inequality even worse , as President Trump’s policies have. It’s radical because soaring inequality is starting to threaten the basic fabric of American life. Many people have grown frustrated and cynical. Average life expectancy, amazingly, has fallen over the past few years. Over the sweep of history, the main reason that societies have declined, as the scholars Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have written , is domination “by a narrow elite that have organized society for their own benefit at the expense of the vast mass of people.” The name of Acemoglu’s and Robinson’s book on this phenomenon is, “Why Nations Fail.”	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

The proposals are instead efforts to undo some of the extreme economic changes of recent decades and to ensure that most Americans workers — not just a narrow elite — fully benefit from economic growth. The proposals also happen to be popular, broadly speaking. On social issues, like abortion and immigration, the country is deeply divided. But clear majorities support higher taxes on the wealthy, higher taxes on corporations, more education funding and expanded government health insurance. No wonder: Americans don’t resent success, but they do resent not receiving their fair share of economic growth.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Cory Booker and Kamala Harris want to lift the after-tax pay of the middle class and poor. Kirsten Gillibrand and others support reducing major living costs, like child care and education. Perhaps most important, some Democrats have begun pushing for a wealth tax — to reverse the upward redistribution of the past 40 years.

Middle-class Americans. It’s called the property tax, as Noah Smith of Bloomberg Opinion has noted. Every year, homeowners pay a percentage of their house value in tax. A house, of course, is the biggest asset that most families own. If middle-class families can pay an annual tax on their main source of wealth, wealthy families can, too. The United States as we have known it — optimistic, future-oriented and more powerful than any other nation — cannot survive the stagnation of mass living standards over many decades.

2019-03-19	The Washington Post (Online)	How Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren seized their moment to shine	txt-opeds/2193925312.xml.txt	Democratic primary voters seeking substance could have found plenty of meaty policy talk Monday night. Both Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) demonstrated their grasp of an array of complex topics. Appearing on MSNBC's ""Hardball"" from Iowa, Booker delivered one of his most impressive performances to date, talking about everything from a pardon for President Trump (wait for the Mueller report, he said, but no pardon for rich, entitled presidents) to Amazon [founded by Jeffrey P. Bezos, who owns the Post], which Booker wanted to come to Newark. He proudly declared himself a capitalist but made clear that we cannot let corporations ""socialize"" their costs (e.g. pollute rivers) or monopolize markets. He resisted the siren call for court-packing, preferring to look at ideas for limiting Supreme Court justices' terms. He sprinkled in some details about farmers' financial woes (always a good move in Iowa) and all the while adhered to his optimistic message and promise to reunite the country. If you wanted a young, hopeful and energetic candidate — but one with executive experience as a troubled city's mayor and a reputation for working across the aisle (e.g. criminal justice reform) — you'd find Booker's performance compelling.

2019-03-19	The Washington Post (Online)	How Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren seized their moment to shine	txt-opeds/2193925312.xml.txt	Monday night afforded Warren an opportunity to shine at a CNN town hall hosted by Jake Tapper. She expounded at length on her housing legislation (""it says for people who are living in formerly red-lined areas there are going to be some special assistance for first-time home buyers, for people who got cheated in the run-up to the housing crash and lost their homes, [they'll get] special assistance for folks to get that first home"") and clarified that her Medicare-for-all includes intermediary steps (""Some folks are talking about, let's start lowering the age. Maybe bringing it down to 60, 55, 50. That helps cover people who are most at risk""), making clear that universal coverage is her goal. She wants a commission to study reparations, repeal of all voter suppression laws, abolition of the electoral college and creation of a wealth tax.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-03-19	The Washington Post (Online)	How Cory Booker and Elizabeth Warren seized their moment to shine	txt-opeds/2193925312.xml.txt	One had the sense that there is not a single substantial issue that Warren has not thought deeply about and come up with a proposed solution. She's far and away the most wonkish candidate, and the one with the most comprehensive agenda. What was new about her appearance was the degree to which she opened up about her family and faith. She delivered a high-octane mini-sermon: One doesn't normally associate her with stirring rhetoric, but she certainly connected with and moved the audience. Warren is no Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). She declares herself in favor of ""markets with rules."" She is sunny and occasionally lighthearted, never grumpy. She can boast of specific legislation she carried and Republicans with whom she had worked. She's talking about ""fundamental change"" but within the context of fixing (e.g. ethics reform) — and not blowing up — government as we know it. For those bent on slapping a label on their foreheads (socialist) that scares most Americans and matching Trump's angry populism (but from the left), there's no one like Sanders. For other Democrats on the progressive wing of the party, it's hard to figure out why they wouldn't pick Warren over Sanders. Maybe with more exposure for Warren, as through Monday's town hall, these voters will reconsider.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Winning means finding the sweet spot, the overlap between these two imperatives. As this column goes to press, just before the second round of Democratic debates, many candidates seem to have forgotten the second half of the equation. They are taking positions that Democrats like but the American people don't, making it more likely that President Trump will be re-elected. The most recent NPR/Marist survey provides detailed insight into this dynamic. For example, a Medicare for All plan that replaces private insurance is supported by 64% of Democrats but only 41% of the electorate. Sixty percent of Democrats back opening a national health-insurance program to illegal immigrants, compared with only 33% of all voters. Only 27% of Americans support decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings; the same small percentage favors reparations for slavery. Abolishing the death penalty wins a majority of Democrats but barely more than a third of the country.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Take health care. Adding a public option—Medicare, Medicaid or something new—to ObamaCare is supported by 91% of Democrats and a 70% supermajority of the electorate. Government regulation of drug prices is backed by 80% of Democrats as well as two-thirds of all voters. Or consider immigration. For many years, surveys have shown overwhelming support for providing legal status and a path to citizenship to the Dreamers, young people brought illegally to this country as children. The NPR/Marist survey is the latest in a long line to find strong support for offering illegal immigrants who meet a stringent list of requirements a chance to move out of the shadows and become citizens.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Eighty-nine percent of Americans favor extending mandatory background checks to weapons purchased at gun shows and private sales. Nearly three-fourths of Democrats, and two-thirds of all Americans, support legalizing marijuana nationwide. Despite a decadelong recovery from the Great Recession, voters remain concerned about the economic struggles of working- and middle-class families, and about the accumulation of wealth at the top. This explains why a national minimum wage of $15 an hour is favored by 56% of Americans, and a wealth tax by 61%.

Swing voters have disappeared, they claim, replaced by polarized partisans. The party that best mobilizes its base will win, and that means running on issues that excite the base. Yet the evidence contradicts that argument. Recent surveys show that although most Americans are bound by their party affiliation in their choice of president, as many as 1 in 5 are not. Many of these swing voters identify as independent or moderate. Their decision to support or oppose Mr. Trump's re-election, which is likely to determine the outcome in 2020, depends on the alternative Democrats offer.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

In a head-to-head contest, the latest NBC/WSJ poll finds, swing voters prefer former Vice President Joe Biden to Mr. Trump by 32 percentage points. At the other end of the continuum, Mr. Trump edges Sen. Kamala Harris by 4 points, with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in between. In an that deserves a wide readership, veteran Democratic analyst Ruy Teixeira shows that base mobilization has not been the source of past Democratic defeats and won't be the key to victory in 2020. Even if African-American turnout in 2016 had matched the level of 2012, he finds, Hillary Clinton would have lost. By contrast, if she had managed to reduce by one quarter (from 39 to 30 points) Mr. Trump's margin of victory among whites without college degrees, she'd be well into her third year as president. This isn't mission impossible. In 2012 Barack Obama held the Republican margin among noncollege whites to 25 points.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Apparently he heard something during his morning excursion into the right-wing media house of horrors that persuaded him he's in danger of looking weak, as conference committee negotiations over a border funding bill begin: In saying this, Trump is actually restricting the maneuvering room Republicans will have in these bipartisan conference talks, which are focused on finding a compromise on Department of Homeland Security funding that will avert another government shutdown in mid-February. Trump is letting it be known that he will continue to define ""border security"" as a ""wall"" or ""barrier"" — that is, as a down payment on a large and monolithic superstructure that fulfills the fantasy he promised his supporters. That could make it harder for Republicans to accept a deal that spends billions on real border security, just not quite to Trump's specifications, without enraging the base.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

And the early signs are that they are going to do just this. What Democrats will proposeI've got new details on the opening bid Democrats plan to make in these talks. According to a House Democratic aide, Democrats will put on the table the following proposals: Democrats will propose hundreds of millions of dollars in new funding to address the humanitarian crisis at the border, with upgraded facilities that are better equipped to deal with just-arrived asylum-seeking families and children, including additional medical care and counseling.

(I was unable to obtain the exact figure.) However, this would not be wall or barrier money. Instead, it would be for things such as increased personnel and more sensors along the border, and drug-scanning technology at ports of entry. That border security investment would also include more money for Homeland Security personnel who would focus on investigating human trafficking, something both sides agree is a serious problem. Democrats will also push to include funding in a related bill that provides more than a half-billion dollars for investments in economic aid and shoring up institutions in Central American countries, to address the terrible civil conditions prompting these migrations of asylum-seekers.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

This set of proposals is much more targeted toward that crisis than Trump's wall is. As Dara Lind put it in an exhaustive piece for Vox on the real border crisis, the United States is now seeing ""large numbers of children and families, often in large groups, crossing the border without papers to turn themselves in to U.S. authorities.""

But this hyped crisis is the one Trump keeps harping about to make the case for the border wall. Democrats can reframe the debateThe new Democratic offer in conference negotiations is an attempt to reframe this whole debate, and shift it to a reality-based discussion of what the real crisis genuinely calls for right now. On the security side, Democrats will propose improved drug-scanning technology at ports of entry because ports of entry are where most illegal drugs enter.

Trump keeps going on about taped and gagged migrant women, which is also fiction, but still, if he is serious about this being a problem, this investment should appeal to him. I'm also told that Democrats will argue in conference that more personnel and technology are the right answer to the real security challenges of the moment.

Democrats might accept this, provided they are done in keeping with needs-based requests from DHS that are justified with facts and data, under careful congressional scrutiny. They would also have to come with actual concessions to Democrats that take Trump's cruel and draconian asylum-restricting proposals off the table -- money for courts is the better way to reduce backlogs -- and as part of a package that invests major amounts in the humanitarian crisis, which could help a lot of people and save migrant children's lives.

Border protection officials want this humanitarian money and increased personnel to battle trafficking to address a problem that Trump has embellished with fiction but is still nonetheless real. And while Trump has buffoonishly threatened to cut off aid to Central American countries, in keeping with his idea that they are ""sending"" migrants to rip us off, border officials want investments in aid to those countries, because they recognize that migrants have real-world motives rooted in home-country conditions.	7	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But will Trump give Republicans on the conference committee space to negotiate one? As Matthew Gertz documents, ""Fox & Friends"" is now telling Trump that a final deal with ""barriers"" would give Trump a way to say he got his wall but also give Democrats a way to claim victory.

If you weren't, would the world reward you with such blessings? And isn't the fact that you're so rich just evidence that life is fair? So how on earth could it be right to ask you to pay higher taxes? Now here's where things get tricky. When anyone asks you — say, an interviewer on a panel at a conference, or a reporter doing a story about a wealth tax — you share your thoughts and express your dismay. You might even take the initiative and write an op-ed about how awful these proposals are. Someone, after all, needs to speak out!	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

It feeds the story of income inequality and gives that story a handy villain, a bunch of rapacious blood-suckers who think we all ought to be thanking them for hoarding the country's resources. And while Warren is the focus of much of this attention, the more focus there is on billionaires, the less it matters whether she's the next Democratic president or someone else is. Joe Biden, for instance, has some very general ideas that involve increasing taxes on the wealthy, like pretty much every Democrat. He says he wants to reverse the Trump tax cuts and ""get rid of the capital gains loophole for multi-millionaires"" (I'm not sure what loophole he's referring to, though I would hope he supports eliminating the special treatment of capital gains and just taxing them as regular income).	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Biden or another moderate might not be as passionate about it as someone like Warren, but that won't matter, because the incentives will have lined up to make it a reality. To be clear, a wealth tax in particular is still unlikely even if Warren is president, because there are enough genuine questions about whether it would be effective to make its passage through the Senate extremely difficult.

Tax capital gains adjusted for inflation at the same rate as earned income. Make dividends deductible to corporations, but taxable to the individual as regular income. Those two simple changes will raise revenue in a manner that is fair, as the richest will pay a percentage that is at least equal to that paid by those who are just well off. Additionally, it would reward patient capital, save billions on accounting fees, solve the problem related to carried interest and allow American corporations to repatriate more than a trillion dollars in cash from abroad without paying taxes simply by raising their dividends.

At the forum, Tichina Haywood, a night-shift hospital patient care technician from Chicago, stood up to tell Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) that she had recently quit her job. She was, she said, unable to continue to handle the pressure of assisting a nurse with up to 16 infectious patients for 12 hours at a time, for which she received $13.13 an hour.

Job stability, especially for nonunion workers, is far from robust.

But at the same time, it remains a right-to-work state, and while the state's new Democratic governor, Steve Sisolak, is likely to sign a minimum-wage increase this year, the current minimum is still currently $7.25 an hour for employees who receive health insurance through work, and $8.25 for those who do not.

A huge chunk of the primary electorate hasn't been paying much attention, let alone settled on a candidate. I can think of at least five questions, the answers to which may tell us whether she's primed to knock out Biden and become the favorite for the nomination. First, can she campaign from the heart as well as from the head? She's got plenty of plans, more plans than the other contenders combined. Warren arguably has established herself as the wonkiest candidate in this race, or perhaps any race. But Hillary Clinton had plans, too. What Clinton lacked and Warren hasn't yet shown is the ability to connect viscerally with the audience, deliver the soaring rhetoric many Democrats like to hear and show some heart on her sleeve.

Cory Booker's soon after the El Paso shooting, all three of them sounded more emotional and ""presidential.""	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-08-16	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s success depends on her answering these five questions	txt-opeds/2274182440.xml.txt	Second, can she show she can manage President Trump? The absurdly irrelevant Native American DNA issue lingers because it suggests Trump can push her around and put her on defense before she even gets to general election. There are a few ways to deal with this. She could ignore him. She could pummel some other Democrat to show her toughness (but she'd better not pick Biden, as Harris found out) without raising the ire of voters who don't want infighting. Another way would be to go on offense, in ways that get under his skin just as Biden manages to do. I don't suggest she start throwing Twitter bombs at him, but she'd do well to mock him now and then. A president who thinks he might buy Greenland, thinks Kim Jong Un has eyes for only him, acts like Vladimir Putin's lap dog, still hasn't passed Trade 101 and hires the bottom of the barrel deserves a good tongue-lashing now and then. More seriously, she can go after him for his racist incitement. A majority of Americans, according to the aforementioned Fox News poll, already blame to some extent the sentiments Trump has expressed for recent mass shootings. Show voters now that she can go for the jugular, and she would stomp out the last embers of ""unelectable"" talk. Hitting him effectively on something like this will give voters confidence in her sparring abilities and also underscore that Trump's own taunts are pathetically small and juvenile.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-08-16	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s success depends on her answering these five questions	txt-opeds/2274182440.xml.txt	Third, can she navigate the health-care issue? Sanders, the only other top-tier candidate who backs single-payer health care, is sinking and won't provide much cover the next time all the other candidates start whacking away at Medicare-for-all. Warren to date conspicuously has not put out her own health-insurance plan, although that gives her one more shot at taking the single-payer target (in the general election) off her back. Once upon a time (like this past spring), she sounded amenable to public-option ideas as initial steps toward Medicare-for-all. Perhaps, as Harris smartly did, she can come up with a political off-ramp to respond to concerns such as how to transition to such a system, its exorbitant cost and its potentially low reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals that could threaten to create shortages especially in rural areas.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Once all the candidates are focused on knocking her off stride, we'll see if she can keep her cool, avoid looking defensive and substantively respond to legitimate critiques from moderates about her programs. One major line of attack is that her plans (e.g., student-loan forgiveness) aren't necessarily focused on the neediest Americans or working-class people (many of whom don't go to college), who as taxpayers would in effect subsidize richer Americans' health care, college education and more. Another attack she should expect will focus on her wealth tax that has plenty of issues (e.g., moving assets overseas) and is unlikely to provide the money she'll need to pay for everything. She's going to have to level with voters about the prospect of taxes on people who aren't super-duper rich.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Unlike Trump, Bloomberg isn't a know-nothing, has actually run something well, has popular positions on climate change and on guns, and doesn't have a slew of obvious, serious personality flaws. Bloomberg, it seems, is getting serious about running. According to Politico, ""Michael Bloomberg made his second visit to New Hampshire Tuesday, using the opportunity to step up his criticisms of President Donald Trump. . . .

But Sanders and his campaign are alleging that there is a broad bias against him, and he has aimed some of his displeasure at The Post in particular in recent days, suggesting that unsatisfactory coverage in The Post could be a result of his criticisms of Amazon (The Post is owned by Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive.)

The trouble is that there isn't much of a case to be made that Sanders is getting singled out for mistreatment. I've been closely observing media coverage of politics for a couple of decades, first as an academic and now as an opinion writer, and one of the things I concluded long ago is that while biases in news coverage abound, ideological bias is usually the least important. Non-ideological biases in favor of conflict between candidates, in favor of the new over the old, in favor of events over broader conditions and in favor of information that can be obtained quickly under intense deadline pressure all play a far more important role in shaping coverage than whether reporters' personal preferences on abortion or tax policy are finding their way into stories.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

2019-08-14	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders’s real media problem	txt-opeds/2273070895.xml.txt	So let me offer an explanation of what Sanders's real media problem is: Right now Sanders 2020 is suffering from the comparison with Sanders 2016, when his candidacy was a captivating new phenomenon that turned what could have been a dull coronation for Hillary Clinton into a real contest. That made him compelling to reporters — again, always drawn to what's new and what creates conflict — who wrote story after story about this fascinating campaign, particularly the unlikely fact that a rumpled 74-year-old had become the hero of college students everywhere. They covered his policy proposals, but they also covered all the attendant human-interest sidelights such as people getting Bernie tattoos.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-08-14	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders’s real media problem	txt-opeds/2273070895.xml.txt	Sanders's current candidacy doesn't provide that same narrative interest. He's just one candidate among many, running somewhere between second and fourth in every poll — a part of the big story, to be sure, but not the primary protagonist/antagonist, depending on the framing. If during the 2016 primaries he was getting something like half the coverage, most of it positive, now he can expect only to get a much smaller portion of a pie that has been sliced into many more pieces. Is that fair? Perhaps not, but you'd have to define what ""fair"" coverage would look like for all the candidates to say for sure.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-08-14	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders’s real media problem	txt-opeds/2273070895.xml.txt	It's not as though Sanders is being ignored. I did a search on The Post's website and found 28 articles and videos mentioning him that appeared just this Monday and Tuesday. FiveThirtyEight monitors the volume of cable news coverage of the candidates, and what you see is that coverage pretty well tracks poll standing: Joe Biden gets the most, followed by Sanders, Warren and Kamala D. Harris clustered together. You might be able to make a case for why that's wrong, but you can't say it's particularly unfair to Sanders. And here's the thing: I'm sure Sanders knows how this all works. He's a smart guy, and he has been around for a long time. In most of the comments he and his aides make on this topic, you can tell they understand the incentives and proclivities of the media perfectly well.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Sanders might also be looking to energize his supporters, who see him as a rebel fighting an establishment that is terrified of him and will do anything to stop him.

They seem mad mostly at the rich, who paid little in income taxes as a share of just their income and virtually nothing as a share of their net worth. In some cases, actually nothing. Some billionaires — reportedly including the owner of this newspaper! — paid zero dollars in income taxes during a handful of years. All as their fortunes swelled. Fume all you want, but the tax system is working exactly how it was designed to.

As a society, we could make different choices. There's a long menu of options to wring more money out of the very rich, including some good proposals from President Biden. Let's start with options that are popular but somewhat problematic. Many on the left love wealth taxes, such as those promoted by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass). She has proposed taking 2 percent annually of fortunes greater than $50 million (3 percent for wealth above $1 billion). While the idea polls extremely well, its constitutionality is questionable. The Supreme Court has struck down wealth taxes before; given the court's composition today, a different result seems unlikely.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

So if we want to tax the rich, here are some alternative options.	txt-opeds/2540019800.xml.txt	There's also the thorny problem of assessing the value of very rich people's assets every year. That's easy for publicly traded securities (such as Tesla stock), but for more illiquid assets (a closely held business, art collection, intellectual-property rights to Taylor Swift's song catalogue), valuation can be easily manipulated if no recent transaction has taken place. Implementing an annual wealth tax is therefore likely to be an enormous boondoggle for professional appraisers, and to leave the Internal Revenue Service vastly outgunned. Similar administrative headaches would occur if we annually ""mark to market"" the value of assets, another frequently proposed idea. This involves taxing not people's wealth, per se, but taxing their capital gains according to how much their assets grew (or shrank) each year, even if those assets never got sold.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

New research suggests that Americans really don't like the idea of taxing capital gains before a sale, viewing it as unfair. And what happens when rich people's assets decline in value? If there's a giant recession, and Facebook stock tanks, does Uncle Sam cut Mark Zuckerberg a check? So let's talk about some more promising ideas. One, which Biden has endorsed, is raising the corporate income tax rate. If corporate income taxes are primarily paid by shareholders — as economists generally believe — that means raising corporate rates would effectively increase the tax burden on the Warren Buffetts of the world.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

So if we want to tax the rich, here are some alternative options.	txt-opeds/2540019800.xml.txt	We could also impose a national consumption tax. Right now, billionaires can fund lavish lifestyles by borrowing at low interest rates against their stock holdings and use this untaxed money to fund things such as mansions or yachts. A consumption tax would hit such purchases. Consumption taxes tend to be regressive, though, so other policy changes would be required to prevent hurting the poor. Then there's Biden's proposal to raise the top tax rate on capital gains, and more important, to change when such taxes get triggered. Right now, rich people can bequeath enormous estates to their heirs tax-free (up to a certain amount), and any gains their stocks or other assets have accrued over their lifetimes get wiped out at death as though they'd never happened, at least for tax purposes. Under Biden's plan, however, the tax code would treat gains above a certain threshold as ""realized"" whenever the owner dies or otherwise transfers the asset to someone else. When either event happens, capital gains taxes would be due.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But this ""deferral benefit"" could be addressed by basically charging interest for all the years a person held on to stock before dying, or either selling or gifting it. This idea, sometimes called a retrospective capital tax, was proposed some 80 years ago by Nobel laureate William Vickrey and has been developed further since. These kinds of changes would go a long way toward making sure those who live off their wealth pay their ""fair share,"" just as regular wage-earners do. They wouldn't guarantee that every billionaire's fortune gets taxed, particularly if we're unwilling to eliminate tax benefits for charitable giving. There are other ways for the well-heeled to legally duck the Tax Man, too. That's why adding a few different policy changes would be helpful, if the goal is to get the richest Americans to pony up.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

2020-01-24	New York Times (Online)	Anyone but Trump? Not So Fast	txt-opeds/2344426982.xml.txt	Let’s not exchange one reckless president for another. Donald Trump is a lawless president and revolting person who richly deserved his impeachment and, in a better world, would be convicted in the Senate and removed from the White House. That’s my view, as it is the view of a plurality — albeit a narrow plurality — of the American people. Ergo, every American who feels this way has a moral obligation to vote for whoever winds up being the Democratic nominee, even if the nominee turns out to be Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Right? Well, hang on. I’ve been thinking about this question for a while now, thanks mainly to some good-natured prodding from my colleague Gail Collins in our published conversations. The strongest version of the argument is this: Say what you will about Warren’s or Sanders’s policies, neither candidate poses any serious threat to our constitutional order, just as neither possesses Trump’s crippling character flaws or has such contempt for the institutions, traditions and habits of a free and civilized society.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-24	New York Times (Online)	Anyone but Trump? Not So Fast	txt-opeds/2344426982.xml.txt	In short, while a Warren or Sanders presidency might drastically rearrange the furniture in our common democratic home, it will not — as Trump’s has — seek to blast away at the foundations. What’s more, a decisive loss by Trump might have the added benefit of chastening conservatives who abandoned their former “free people, free markets” convictions in favor of Trump’s nativist demagogy. It’s a serious argument that deserves respect. But it falls short in three big ways. First, the argument overstates the extent to which this presidency has eroded the foundations of liberal democracy at home and abroad. Has Trump abandoned NATO? No. Has he lifted sanctions on Russia? No. Has he closed the borders to all immigrants? No. Did the president steal the midterms, or stop Congress from impeaching him? No. Has he significantly suppressed the press?

Nor does it lessen my apprehensions about what Trump, after an acquittal in the Senate, may seek to do with a second term. Yet for the overwhelming majority of Americans, life is pretty much the same under Trump as it was under Obama. The truth of Trumpism is that it’s a morally corrosive and corrupting force, not a politically or economically catastrophic one. It’s a reality Trump’s critics need to internalize lest their criticism become a self-defeating caricature.	2	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-24	New York Times (Online)	Anyone but Trump? Not So Fast	txt-opeds/2344426982.xml.txt	Second, the argument understates the radicalism of what Sanders and Warren propose. Theirs is not a painless policy massage in the direction of a kinder, gentler economy. It’s a frontal and highhanded assault on American capitalism. If it succeeded, it would entail devastating dislocations to millions of workers lasting for years. If it failed, it would have devastating effects on the country lasting for decades. How devastating? In October, Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute tallied the costs of Mr. Sanders’s policy goals. By his calculations, the federal government would double in size. Half the American work force would be employed by the government, Mr. Riedl writes. Government spending as a percent of G.D.P. would rise to 70 percent (in Sweden, it’s less than 50 percent). The 15.3 percent payroll tax would hit 27.2 percent to help pay for Medicare for All. Total additional outlays would reach $97.5 trillion on top of the nearly $90 trillion the federal, state and local governments are projected to spend over the next decade.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Warren’s terminology is less forthright. Her ambition is no less breathtaking. Fracking and health insurance — two industries that collectively employ hundreds of thousands of people — wouldn’t be better-regulated or reformed in her administration. They’d be abolished. Much of Silicon Valley, America’s premier growth engine for 40 years, would be turned into a quasi-public utility. She doesn’t have one climate plan. She has at least five, costing in the trillions, which she plans to finance partly with a wealth tax that, as a law professor, she surely knows is unconstitutional.

And an assertively left-wing presidency would spark a right-wing backlash that would have all of the fear and rage of the left’s Resistance — but none of its restraint.

But the strain for “civility” is tiring. During an episode of “The View” this month, Senator Elizabeth Warren explained her wealth tax plan for the top one-tenth of the 1 percent.

Since Ms. McCain, a conservative, joined as a co-host on “The View” in October of 2017, she has become its most polarizing and predictable figure, the common denominator in the show’s most contentious round tables. In the early days after her arrival, her on-air spats made for fun TV. Now it’s just exhausting. It has become the norm to watch Ms. McCain, the daughter of Senator John McCain, square off against her co-hosts in a barrage of vehement exchanges — leveraging her political parentage, accusing her co-hosts of supporting infanticide, using her platform to push back against assault weapons bans and progressive immigration policy. The increasingly aggressive rejoinders by her co-hosts have escalated to the daytime TV equivalent of a cage fight for the viewing public, reflecting the frustrations of discourse in our current political climate under the magnifying glass of harsh studio lighting.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

On Monday, the conservative co-host Abby Huntsman announced her immediate departure from the show, citing plans to work on the campaign of her father, Jon Huntsman Jr., for governor in Utah. But it has been suggested that the move was also fueled by rumored discord between Ms. Huntsman and Ms. McCain, who were once considered to be allies on the set. (Ms. McCain has wished Ms. Huntsman “nothing but the best on her next chapter.”) For some viewers, Ms. McCain is the privileged product of conservative nepotism, capitalism and the American military-industrial complex.

When she appeared on the late-night talk show “Watch What Happens Live” in September, she informed the host, Andy Cohen, that every day she assumes she could get fired, because of “the tone of where we are culturally.” It’s a deflecting refrain that has been employed by standup comedians and political commentators alike — anyone bemoaning the rise of so-called cancel culture when facing pushback for harmful rhetoric. And in December, when her co-host Whoopi Goldberg sharply told Ms. McCain, “Girl, please stop talking,” Ms. McCain took to Twitter the next day to rally “all the fellow conservative ‘girls’ who won’t be quiet.” The tweet was accompanied by a “Game of Thrones” Mother of Dragons GIF, implying that Ms. Goldberg’s use of the word “girl” was infantilizing rather than common black American parlance.	3	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The day after that particular clash with Ms. McCain, Ms. Goldberg opened the show by insisting that the nature of their exchange was nothing of concern, noting that co-hosts on “The View” have always “clashed and gone back and forth.” Ms. McCain, for her part, reminded everyone that this is to be expected, as she is “hyper, hyper conservative.” This “agree to disagree” stance is frustrating and lies in stark contrast with the current political moment, when many are skeptical of the idea of civil discourse and who it is meant to benefit.	4	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The country can't simply pick up where it left off before Trump took office. The radicalized conservatism that dominates the Republican Party will not go away even if he is defeated. The inequalities of class and race that helped fueled Trump's rise have deepened during his presidency. You might say restoring the norms that Trump threatens requires transformation.

Together, they long for a politics focused on freedom, fairness and the future. What should bring moderates and progressives together is an idea put forward long ago by the late social thinker Michael Harrington: ""visionary gradualism."" The phrase captures an insight from each side of their debate: Progressives are right that reforms unhinged from larger purposes are  typically ephemeral. But a vision disconnected from first steps and early successes can shrivel up and die. Vision and incremental change are not opposites. In our nation's history, the two have reinforced each other — for example, in protecting the environment, achieving social security for the elderly and assistance to the unemployed, protecting civil rights, and expanding health insurance coverage. This lesson will apply for any new Democratic president, no matter which wing of the party she or he represents.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

In the face of such skepticism, I would insist that it's important to recognize both the Clinton and Obama presidencies as successful. Doing so does not mean ignoring frustrations over the degree to which both men continued to operate within the Reagan consensus, failed to create durable electoral legacies beyond their own times in office and left behind deep economic inequalities that Democrats ought to be in the business of reversing.

As for Clinton, there were reasons he received such a rapturous reception at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. He was, after all, the man who ended 12 years of Republican control of the White House. And the 1990s really were years of exceptional economic growth — and relative peace.	6	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Both pushed against rising inequality, in contrast to Republican administrations since Reagan that aggravated the inequities in our economy with large tax cuts tilted heavily toward the wealthy. (President George H.W. Bush was an exception to this pattern.)

In Clinton's case, he pushed these assumptions further along with a broad deregulatory program for banks and the financial industry, genuinely damaging limits on the entitlement for welfare and an enthusiastic embrace of free trade. Obama inherited an economic disaster created by the irresponsibility of Wall Street and the world of finance. In cooperation with other national leaders, he righted a global economy in free fall (an achievement for which he still gets too little credit). But he repaired the system without challenging the institutions and structures that led to the disaster in the first place. At the end of the Obama presidency, the overall economy was humming again. But the damage of the 2008 crash was still being felt in many parts of the country — and many of those places produced substantial electoral swings from Obama to Trump in 2016.	8	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Did they leave behind serious social and economic imbalances they should have done more to right? Also, yes. That is why their presidencies present such conundrums to progressives. Let's start with the obvious: Clinton's relationship with a White House intern that led to his impeachment came under renewed and even harsher scrutiny after the rise of the #MeToo movement. This has affected overall assessments of his presidency, more so as the years have gone by. His legacy would be received differently if his time in office had been followed by a successful Al Gore presidency. As it was, George W. Bush's policies further aggravated inequalities, and the economic crash on his watch was a disaster for the already vulnerable.	9	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Economic growth in the late 1990s was exceptional, disadvantaged groups enjoyed strong income gains, and government (through programs such as an expanded earned-income tax credit) sought to redistribute some of the largesse the economy was producing. The country's strong fiscal position left room for further redistribution efforts. It's also important to remember that Clinton won reelection in 1996 in part because of his success in resisting Republican cuts to ""Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment,"" his battle cry that helped stop Newt Gingrich's ""revolution"" in its tracks.	10	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Bush — sped along deindustrialization that had begun in the 1970s and 1980s. The brunt of these policies hit hardest in the historically industrial states that moved to Trump in 2016. Trade was by no means the only driver here. Automation and technological change were as important, but promises of relief for those hurt by foreign trade never materialized in a substantial way.

The Clinton-era belief was that ""the best way to achieve progressive policy goals was by harnessing and redirecting the wealth that a less-regulated and more-innovative private sector alone could generate."" What Kilgore called the ""create-then-redistribute model for Democratic economic policy"" effectively passed away after the financial crisis in 2008. It shouldn't be hard to understand that Obama was so fearful of a comprehensive economic collapse during his first months in office that he resisted putting pressure on the financial sector. Still, he could have done more to hold it accountable once the emergency passed. The Dodd-Frank financial reform was certainly a major step forward — important enough that the Trump administration set to work dismantling large parts of it — but it was less far-reaching than it could have been.	12	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The most ""socialist"" and, at the time, controversial of Obama's policies — the bailout of the auto industry involving massive government subsidy and large-scale federal intervention — was one of his most successful ventures, substantively and politically. The auto industry came back, and none of the fears of the program's critics were realized. And there is little doubt that Obama's support for rescuing the industry and Mitt Romney's opposition to it were key to Obama's 2012 victories in both Michigan and Ohio.	13	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

And his stimulus was decidedly progressive in moving money to Americans with the lowest incomes and investing in clean energy. His signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, reflected what might be seen as the classic Obama synthesis. It took ideas from conservatives (the health-care exchanges, insurance subsidies, the mandate to buy insurance) to produce far-reaching social change. But there is, again, the paradox of centrism: The plan might have been even more popular — and Obama's party might have been saved from its current divisive health-care debate — if the proposal had included a public option alongside private insurance. That feature was killed in part because of opposition from moderate Senate Democrats, to say nothing of Republicans.	14	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

This made a second, much-needed stimulus package even more politically difficult than it already was. As the economics writer Noam Scheiber noted in his book, ""The Escape Artists,"" Obama ""spent much of his first term more taken with the case against deficits than with the case for jobs."" It was, in the oldest sense of the term, a conservative preoccupation. Obama's crack at balance brought him criticism from both right and left. Many among the wealthy condemned him as a socialist who did not appreciate the heroism of entrepreneurs (whom he had in fact helped rescue). Progressives saw his administration as more interested in nursing Wall Street back to health than in curtailing its excesses. The financial sector emerged as powerful as ever and, in the Trump years, began the process of dismantling the reforms Obama had signed into law and the regulations he had put in place. Obama was caught in the middle of all this — ""middle"" being the appropriate word in many respects.	15	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Pete Buttigieg underscored the costs of this by noting that throughout his own lifetime, ""Reagan supply-side conservatism … created the terms for how Democrats as well as Republicans made policy.""

In 2016, it did, in the form of Bernie Sanders's campaign and the reappearance of democratic socialism as an energetic force in American politics.

The political center can no longer be a halfway point between Democrats and Republicans because the GOP has veered so far to the right. The New York Times' David Leonhardt described the new terrain well: Most voters don't share the centrist preferences of Washington's comfortable pundit class. Most voters want to raise taxes on the rich and corporations. They favor generous Medicare and Social Security, expanded Medicaid, more financial aid for college, a higher minimum wage and a bigger government role in job creation.

At such a moment, moderates should welcome, not fear, the left's boldness. A vibrant left has always been a central component of any successful era of social reform. By offering plans and proposals on what Harrington called ""the left wing of the possible,"" socialists, social democrats and left-liberals have redefined the political playing field. Consider that when Warren proposed a wealth tax on fortunes of $50 million or more, moderate voices responded by saying her idea was too radical or unworkable — and then urged an increase in the capital-gains tax or other approaches to taxing large fortunes instead. She had redefined the intellectual playing field; ""moderation"" now entailed ideas that were once seen as ""leftist."" As Robert Borosage noted in the Nation , Warren's proposal underscored a fundamental unfairness in the American system: that while the ""primary source of wealth for most middle-class families — their homes — is taxed each year in the property tax,"" the ""primary source of wealth of the very rich — their investments — is only taxed when sold or transferred, if then.""	21	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

And she would use the proceeds from the tax — she estimates it would raise $2.7 trillion over a decade — to finance ambitious social initiatives. This was a policy twofer. Warren simultaneously underscored just how much money is sitting at the top of the economy and then showed how much could be done to lift those at its lower rungs without resorting to broad-based tax increases. There were legitimate questions raised about how her wealth tax would work and whether it could be effective in a world in which capital can be moved around so easily. She certainly generated a backlash among billionaires, and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination was a response both to Warren's rise in the polls and Biden's perceived weaknesses.

Warren's struggles over the details of a single-payer plan showed how problematic this approach is as an immediate next step. But it is testimony to the room the idea opened in the policy debate that Post opinion writer Paul Waldman was able to say this of Biden's health plan, which includes a public option: ""In 2009 when the ACA was being a debated, a plan like this one would have been considered almost radically leftist.""

One telltale sign that a political debate is turning in a new direction is the adoption of the rising side's ideas by its adversaries. Democrats and liberals in the 1980s ratified the new Reagan disposition by beginning to speak its language and offering policies consistent with its objectives. That both Clinton and, to a lesser degree, Obama operated within this consensus is precisely why their legacies are complicated. For the most part, Republicans have resisted altering their course. Only a decisive defeat will open the space needed for a larger GOP reformation. But quietly, leading conservatives and libertarians are acknowledging contemporary capitalism's problems and adopting critiques that originated on the left. Thus did Sen. Marco Rubio (R- Fla.) issue a remarkable report last year arguing that business was underinvesting in their own workers because of a shift in corporate behavior toward valuing the interests of shareholders over all other stakeholders.

In a statement on the purpose of the corporation widely interpreted as a direct response to growing discontent with capitalism, the Business Roundtable explicitly broke with this limited view of the modern corporation's obligations, emphasizing that they extended to other ""stakeholders."" Proper corporate goals, the chief executives declared, included ""investing in our employees,"" ""supporting the communities in which we work"" and promoting ""a healthy environment."" In the meantime, the most provocative new Washington think tank on the center-right is the Niskanen Center, a haven for onetime libertarians who have had enough of hard-right ideology and are championing a new moderation in politics. The work of two of its leading figures, Jerry Taylor and Samuel Hammond, aroused great interest because it faced up to what has long been true — and explicitly rejected what had long been conservative dogma: Many ""big government"" countries (in Scandinavia, for example) are also among the freest nations on Earth. It is time, Hammond argues, to blow up the ""ideological axis"" that runs from ""'small government' libertarian"" to ""'big government' progressive.""

They both chipped away at the Reagan consensus even as they lived within it. In particular, each put the lie to supply-side economics by raising taxes on the wealthy and in the process fostering two periods of exceptional growth. The economic growth Trump likes to brag about was set in motion by an Obama who faced down an economic collapse.

The class warfare against struggling Americans has unfolded in many dimensions aside from tax policy — factory closings and lack of job retraining, corporate greed and irresponsibility, assaults on labor unions, stingy social welfare, mass incarceration and so on — and we’ve seen the results in rising “deaths of despair” from drugs, alcohol and suicide.

Everybody agrees that the drive to be best is sufficient.” Considerable evidence suggests that the same is true of C.E.O.s, and that higher tax rates don’t depress effort. In Switzerland, a shift in tax timing meant that the Swiss were not taxed for one year. This tax holiday, which they knew of in advance, turned out to have no impact on how hard people worked, Banerjee and Duflo write.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

There are legitimate concerns about tax evasion, but it would help if the I.R.S. focused its audits less on impoverished Americans claiming the earned-income tax credit and more on wealthy people with murky assets. It’s ridiculous that the county in all America with the highest audit rate is Humphreys County, Miss., which is poor, rural and three-quarters black. As for the wealth tax, which in Warren’s version would begin at $50 million, there are legitimate concerns about how to value assets, avoid marriage penalties and enable zillionaires to pay when their wealth is illiquid. But we already have a wealth tax — the property tax — that hits widows on Social Security with an illiquid asset (the family home). If these widows can figure it out, tycoons can as well.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

By raising taxes on the wealthy, we could end the lead poisoning that afflicts half a million American kids, we could provide high-quality preschool for all, we could offer treatment for all people with addictions and we could ensure that virtually all kids graduate from a decent high school and at least get a crack at college. The wealthy would still have more money than they could ever spend: Jeff Bezos would have had $87 billion in 2018 if Warren’s wealth tax had been in place all along, rather than $160 billion, according to calculations of Saez and Zucman.

Headlines about Tuesday's election have focused on statewide races in Virginia and New Jersey. But we're more interested in other contests. In Bucks County, Pa., where 31 school-board seats went to advocates of greater parental rights in education. In Bedford County, Va., where the school board chair lost to a write-in candidate who champions parental rights. In Texas's Cypress-Fairbanks Independent School District, where three incumbent school-board members — with a combined 55 years in office — were ousted by newcomers championing parental control over kids' education. Now commentators and analysts are debating why, after years on the back burner, education is suddenly the issue changing our political landscape. Yes, some parents are invested in controversies specific to their districts — masking policies, critical race theory, sexually explicit materials. But suggesting that ""school board moms"" are only, or even primarily, focused on these issues is an inaccurate distraction.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Frustrated by an education system that has long put powerful interests above the well-being of students, parents are finally reclaiming our natural right to direct the education, upbringing and care of our children. Two years ago, few would have imagined that schools would become the next hot-button political topic. But by spring 2020, the covid-19 pandemic had children across America distance-learning at their kitchen tables. Parents were suddenly within earshot of teachers' lessons. Many were astonished to find that, instead of being simply taught reading, writing and arithmetic, their kids were being fed lessons on highly divisive topics of questionable academic benefit.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

None of them put students' interests first. The pandemic brought this into sharp relief. Internal emails show that the National Education Association and the American Federation of Teachers shaped the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidance on returning to school — fulfilling their own wants, but perpetuating a terrible situation for students. In Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, the teachers union last year declared that defunding the police and imposing a wealth tax should be prerequisites for returning to the classroom. This summer, Chicago's teachers union insisted the school district provide rent assistance for students' families and fund a ""restorative justice coordinator"" for every school before they would resume in-person instruction.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

The NEA and AFT rake in hundreds of millions in annual revenue, which fund aggressive lobbying and campaign contributions. They can summon millions of members to sweep their preferred candidates into office by knocking on doors, staffing phone banks and turning out in force to vote. Then there are the conglomerates that milk billions from our education system and funnel those profits into lobbying for, and electing officials who will support, policies that serve their financial interests. From increasing use of their tests to embracing curriculums that require their textbooks, these policies give massive corporations — completely unaccountable to voters — enormous influence in what our children learn.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Our kids pay the price: While districts devote classroom time to the latest ed-school fads, such as examining students' ""white male privilege"" or instructing kindergartners about gender identity, test scores in reading and math recently declined for the first time in a half century, while achievement gaps by race and gender are growing wider. Meanwhile, many parents — increasingly alarmed at these trends — have found incumbent education officials unreceptive to our concerns.

This frustration is what has mobilized parents across the country. Moms for Liberty, which we launched in January, has already expanded to more than 150 chapters in 33 states, representing more than 60,000 members. Since then, we have been criticized for trying to hijack the democratic process by imposing the will of a disruptive, vocal minority over duly elected public officials. We see it differently: Far from subverting democracy, we are embracing what is best about it. Unlike citizens of most nations, Americans elect education officials directly, at the local level, allowing communities to decide for themselves who will help in the formation of their children. But our responsibilities as citizens do not end on Election Day. We continue to hold our elected officials accountable, and if they ignore our input, we vote them out.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But three hours? Its only redeeming quality: It allowed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to demonstrate he is back on his feet and fit. Former vice president Joe Biden had the most to lose, and gain, Tuesday night. He has been under attack from President Trump, who employs his children and makes money off overseas properties, accusing him and his son Hunter over Hunter's work on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. Joe Biden has struggled to aggressively respond. At Tuesday's debate, he was able to do that, making clear he and his son did nothing wrong while calling out Trump as the most corrupt president in history. His answer was not as succinct as it might have been, highlighting that others in the race may have a sharper tongue, but to his great advantage, the first block of the debate saw every candidate attacking Trump.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

His strongest moment of the night might have been his defense of his age, arguing he has experience (""with it comes wisdom,"" he said) and needs no on-the-job training. He said with much justification that he was the only one to get big things done in the past. He was also successful in piling on Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) for being ""vague"" on taxes to pay for Medicare-for-all and zinging Sanders for supporting a hugely expensive health-care plan.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

While she started by hitting a softball out of the park with an easy question about whether impeachment was necessary, she was on the receiving end of constant criticism from moderates who more than held their own. Buttigieg laid into Warren most aggressively for refusing to say whether taxes will go up to pay for her Medicare-for-all plan and for ignoring how unwise it would be to attempt this in a country as divided as ours, especially when alternatives are available. The more times she refused to answer the question on taxes, the worse it got. Even more destructive than holding onto a plan that, as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said, gives Republicans a talking point (socialism!), she looked slippery, a bad image for someone saying she is the person to bring integrity into government. Even Andrew Yang got in a shot, explaining that Warren's wealth tax idea has been tried and repealed in other countries when the plans didn't work.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) on Syria and arguing in favor of getting all U.S. troops out of the Middle East (""I think that we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East,"" Warren said). She actually got to Sanders's left on foreign policy, obliterating a contrast with Trump that other candidates can exploit. Finally, she awkwardly thanked President Barack Obama for helping to pass legislation for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, pointedly refusing to credit Biden, who had just explained his role in rounding up votes.

He also smartly stressed the need to look forward to the day after Trump leaves office when serious problems will persist. Buttigieg particularly shined on foreign policy, explaining that a small contingent of troops was keeping the Kurds from being slaughtered. He was impassioned and on the money when it came to U.S. leadership in the world. (""You take away the honor of our soldiers, you might as well go after their body armor next. This president has betrayed American values. Our credibility is in tatters,"" he said.) And on gun safety, he lit into former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.) for taking attention off background checks with his plan to forcibly confiscate assault weapons, shoving back on his insinuation that Buttigieg lacked courage on guns. (""I don't need lessons from you in courage, political or personal,"" Buttigieg said.) He wisely backed off a court-packing plan, supporting a review of a variety of reform ideas now circulating. He certainly showed that to be a moderate doesn't mean to lack passion.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

He did that. He was feisty and slyly got in a dig at Warren for saying we should be honest about raising taxes. He was sincere and heartfelt in thanking Americans for their good wishes. Sanders even managed to get in a sound argument on foreign policy opposing Trump for cutting and running in Syria, making the United States an unreliable ally. Along with Buttigieg, Klobuchar may be one of the best contestants to fill Biden's moderate lane if the former vice president stumbles. She had her best debate to date as well. Recognizing that the primary is also a commander-in-chief test for the would-be nominees, she excoriated Trump for making ""Russia great again,"" and laid into Yang for suggesting there was some moral equivalence between Russia and the United States. She also hit Warren on Medicare-for-all, saying there is a difference between ""a plan and a pipe dream."" She also pushed back on the Massachusetts senator for accusing others of defending billionaires. And she made a fine argument about championing antitrust legislation to aid in breaking up Big Tech and gave a preview of how she'd take on Trump on abortion. Her ending tribute to her friend, the late senator John McCain, was a moment of genuine emotion.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

She floundered badly, however, when she kept insisting Twitter should kick Trump off its platform. O'Rourke had a rough debate, in particular getting knocked around for his plan to institute mandatory buybacks of assault weapons. The debate vividly demonstrated just how fluid the race really is.

Warren has at least 65 staffers with a dozen offices in Iowa, says aide Jason Noble, in part because she was able to lasso much of the state's core political talent early on, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)'s caucus director from 2016. Noble, a former political reporter for the Des Moines Register, said that one-on-one campaigning is the key to winning this caucus state, where personal relationships matter and hours of time together over the previous year tend to cement commitments when the three-hour caucuses get underway on a cold night next February.

Her “regulated markets” alternative instead presumes that, when competition fails to protect families, it’s better to build guard rails at the top of a cliff than put ambulances below. This means not freedom to inflict harm (pollute, monopolize) but freedom from harm (climate violence, financial fraud, unsafe products). Given the corrosive surge in income inequality, Senator Warren has proposed new structural changes reminiscent of how F.D.R.’s New Deal in the 1930s pledged “to save capitalism from itself.” They include an ultramillionaires’ wealth tax and a proposal to break up tech giants that are digitally stifling small businesses and economic opportunity.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

(The ad tax, requiring all media outlets to pay a 3 percent tax on advertising revenue, would affect The Post, and,  with other media companies and local broadcasters, the company is opposing it.) A move to impose a ""wealth tax"" on incomes higher than $250,000 was fortunately defeated in an 8-to-5 vote, but it's clear the idea has taken root with the so-called progressive wing of the council and is sure to resurface again, particularly if tax-and-spend candidates for the council prevail in this fall's general elections.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

The Microsoft mogul turned philanthropist said his ""early money can accelerate things"" in developing a vaccine against Covid-19.

This effort comes in addition to the billions Mr. Gates already has spent fighting other infectious diseases, and the $125 million he announced in March to tackle Covid-19. Mr. Gates's plans are a rebuttal to proposals for confiscatory tax policy that punish wealth creation. If wealth taxes of the kind proposed by Elizabeth Warren and now entertained by the Financial Times were in place in the 1980s, Mr. Gates's roughly $100 billion fortune might be a tenth of that.

Infrastructure talks just collapsed, with Republicans scratching their heads, wondering where on earth we could find the money to save our cratering bridges and highways, among other things. This was the same crowd who happily helped Donald Trump slash tax rates for corporations and the ultrawealthy in 2017. Meanwhile, ProPublica cracked open the vault on America’s biggest tax grifters, revealing how the Midas men dip, dodge and duck, paying pennies on the dollar, if that, while we suckers have to pony up. “In 2007, Jeff Bezos, then a multibillionaire and now the world’s richest man, did not pay a penny in federal income taxes,” ProPublica reported. “He achieved the feat again in 2011.

2019-10-15	The Washington Post (Online)	Sanders and Warren are widening the Democratic Party’s left lane	txt-opeds/2305687681.xml.txt	Early in the presidential race, many political analysts were eager to write off the two most progressive candidates vying for the Democratic nomination. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had taken the party establishment by surprise in 2016, they argued, but he wouldn't be able to replicate his success in a more crowded field. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) had policy chops, they conceded, but that wouldn't help her catch fire with voters who were most concerned with who could beat President Trump. Those predictions have been proved wrong. Tuesday's Democratic primary debate in Ohio will feature former vice president Joe Biden in his usual position at center stage, mirroring his place in the ""center lane"" of the nomination contest. He will be flanked on either side by Sanders and Warren, who have emerged as his top two rivals for the nomination (with Warren now arguably the front-runner). And they will be competing in a race that, as my Nation colleague D.D. Guttenplan argues, is ""dramatically widening the entire left lane of American politics.""	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Their support for policies including Medicare-for-all, a Green New Deal, a wealth tax, student-debt cancellation and more has expanded widely held notions of what is possible. These ideas have not just been mentioned in the mainstream debate; thanks to Sanders's and Warren's courage and clarity of vision, they have dominated the discourse. This has often left the rest of the field flailing to defend tired centrist policies or, in some cases, scrambling to move left in an attempt to keep up. The progressive senators' success has also stemmed in part from a decision to set aside their differences and join forces against the pro-corporate Democratic establishment. While Sanders is an avowed socialist and Warren an unabashed progressive capitalist, they share a commitment to reining in corporate power and a mutual respect. That tacit alliance was clear at the last debate when Sanders and Warren teamed up to bat down misleading attacks on Medicare-for-all and redirect the focus to the perfidies of the insurance industry. They have been similarly in sync on key economic issues, such as trade and workers' rights.	1	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Both candidates have sworn off PAC donations and high-dollar fundraisers. Yet they still raised significantly more in the third quarter of the year than their closest opponents, with Sanders and Warren bringing in $25.3 million and $24.6 million, respectively.

In the near term, the impeachment inquiry in the House of Representatives could take energy and attention from the ideas and movements that have shaped the primary to date. Some are waging a campaign to drive a wedge between the Sanders and Warren camps that, if successful, could severely deflate the energy among progressives. And as Sanders scales back his activity in the wake of his heart attack, Warren is confronting a new wave of personal attacks on what seems like a daily basis. As the campaign enters its next phase, it's important that progressives remain united and remember who their real opponent is. That will demand that Sanders and Warren keep their truce and continue to compete through the boldness of their ideas rather than clash with each other. Meanwhile, the pair's supporters might take a cue from Sanders, who used his recent hospitalization as an opportunity to renew the focus on the issues at the heart of his campaign.

For wonks, the investment that 2020 contenders are making in policy, especially early in the race, is encouraging. It suggests they believe voters are hungry not just for anti-Trump fervor or a good personal story but also substantive ideas for how to better Americans' lives.

We still don’t know how much damage Covid-19 — the coronavirus disease — will do, but it’s reasonable to be very concerned. After all, it appears to be highly transmissible, and it is probably a lot more lethal than ordinary flu. But not to worry, say right-wing pundits and news organizations: It’s all a hoax, a conspiracy by the liberal media to make Donald Trump look bad. Administration officials and Trump himself have echoed their claims. These claims are, of course, crazy.

It’s just the latest battle in a long-running war on truth, on the very idea that there exists an inconvenient objective reality. In the case of Covid-19 the usual suspects were, in part, engaged in projection. After all, they themselves engaged in a concerted effort to politically weaponize the 2014 Ebola outbreak against Barack Obama, whose response was in reality smart and effective.

Remember, conservatives have spent decades denying the reality of climate change, insisting that it’s a gigantic hoax perpetrated by a vast international scientific conspiracy. And as the signs of climate catastrophe multiply, from wildfires in Australia to drought in California, climate denial has only strengthened its grip on the G.O.P. On the eve of the 2018 midterms, a survey found 73 percent of Republican senators denying the scientific consensus that man-made climate change is happening. Or consider how many on the right reacted after their dire predictions of hyperinflation under Obama failed to pan out — not by admitting that they were wrong, but by insisting that the numbers were being cooked.

Indeed, it can be deadly.

At first, it wasn’t clear whether right-wing paranoia was also hampering the response to Covid-19. But recent reporting makes it clear that one major reason the U.S. has lagged far behind other countries in testing for the coronavirus — an essential step in containing its spread — was that Trump didn’t want to believe that there was a crisis.

Last time I checked, however, criticizing America’s leaders was still legitimate.

Bill Cassidy (R-La.) on the Sunday talk shows aptly illustrated how Democrats, with a straightforward, tangible relief package, have rather easily neutered Republicans politically.

But those attacks wilt next to the bill's obvious benefits, as Barrasso found Sunday. After he complained that the bill ""is not supposed to be a bailout,"" host George Stephanopoulos showed Barrasso the front page of his home-state paper the Casper Star-Tribune, which ""shows $1 billion going to your state of Wyoming."" Barrasso conceded that, but complained that ""the formula they used to send this out was biased and unfair.""

Those flimsy complaints aside, Cassidy and Barrasso fell back on exploitative talking points: ""This coronavirus relief bill was not supposed to be about $1,400 checks to illegal immigrants or $1,400 checks to felons who are behind bars,"" Barrasso complained. Cassidy also warned of ""$1.9 billion to give stimulus checks to inmates.""

Right-wing media has largely eschewed the stimulus bill, turning instead to the border crisis and painting it as the first big scandal of the Biden presidency.

Cornyn claimed Biden was ""sending the signal that the border is open,"" while Abbott said the White Houseis ""putting our Border Patrol agents in harm's way,"" among other lurid accusations.

Whether the stimulus ends up helping Biden and the Democrats in next fall's midterms remains an open question. Twenty months is an eon in politics. President Barack Obama's 2009 stimulus package didn't save Democrats from a Republican wave the following year. The best way to keep Democrats' assistance top of mind with voters is to keep passing more needed assistance. The Biden White House, fortunately, seems to recognize this, with infrastructure aid and a $15 minimum wage still on the agenda. Already some moderate Democrats — especially Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) — are wavering. They must understand that the more voters see Democrats working for them, the better the party's fortunes. As for the inevitable question of how to pay for it, Democrats can raise trillions in revenue from politically popular proposals such as a wealth tax, a higher top income-tax rate and increased funding for IRS crackdowns on tax-dodging. The bigger the avalanche of aid, the more Republicans will be forced to rely on voter suppression and other counter-majoritarian tactics — which themselves can be blunted if Senate Democrats also push through the voting rights bill that the House passed earlier this month.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Envy and resentment fuel class warfare, and lackluster economic growth throughout the Obama presidency has made people less optimistic and more inclined to fault others for their circumstances. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll this week reports that four-in-five Americans ""were either 'angry because our political system seems to only be working for the insiders with money and power' or 'anxious and uncertain because the economy still feels rocky and unpredictable'--or both."" Liberals want to address income disparities through wealth redistribution--by taking money from more productive people and giving it to the less productive in the name of ""fairness"" as the left defines it. They want to raise income taxes, expand the welfare state, lift minimum wages and strengthen the bargaining power of unions. Mr. Sanders has been the most explicit about this, even going so far as to propose a wealth tax. ""Our economic goals have to be redistributing a significant amount of [wealth] back from the top 1%,"" the senator said in July.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

And all the focus on divvying up existing wealth instead of creating more risks making matters far worse for the people they are trying to help and the country in general. ""To the extent that the expanding welfare state allows more people to live without working--and therefore without earning income or developing their own human capital--supporters of the welfare state are contributing to the very income disparities they so much decry,"" writes economist Thomas Sowell in his new book, ""Wealth, Poverty and Politics."" Mr. Sowell is the author of more than 30 books over the past four decades, many having to do with what drives different social and economic outcomes among different groups in the U.S. and elsewhere. In his latest tome, he draws from this well of research to do what he has done so well for so long: question basic assumptions behind public policy and follow the facts where they lead him.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

In fact, huge disparities are the norm, not the exception, because the demographic, cultural and political factors that influence the development of the human capital that makes people productive also tend to be unequal. In 2013, only 9% of U.S. women with college degrees who gave birth were unmarried, versus 61% of women who were high-school dropouts and unmarried.

""Equal opportunity, in the sense of being judged and rewarded by the same standards as others, cannot possibly mean equal life chances for children born and raised in these very different settings,"" writes Mr. Sowell. The ""fact that life is unfair is not the same as saying that a particular institution, or a particular society, is unfair."" The argument that social mobility is a thing of the past in the U.S. also is disputable. Longitudinal studies by the IRS and others that measure the progress of individuals over time show that the American dream is alive and well. One such paper  , published by the Pew Charitable Trusts in 2012, measured ""whether a person has more or less income, earnings or wealth than his or her parents did at the same age"" and concluded that ""the vast majority"" of Americans had higher incomes, while 50% had greater wealth.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

He was excoriated at the time for perpetuating the anti-Semitic stereotype that Jews are guilty of dual loyalty.

In his long, rambling discourse on the U.S. Embassy move to Jerusalem, Iran, the economy and more, he declared, ""You have people — Jewish people — and they are great people and they don't love Israel enough.""

As Yair Rosenberg explained in a column for The Post: So is Trump a philo-Semite or an anti-Semite? The answer is both. The principle that explains his seemingly contradictory outlook toward Jews is simple: Trump believes all the anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews. But he sees those traits as admirable. To Trump, the belief that Jews are foreign interlopers who use their wealth to serve their own clannish interests is not a negative — as it is for traditional anti-Semites — but rather a positive. He wants Jews to be his attorneys and manage his money, so that he, too, can be rich. He wants them in his political corner, so that he, too, can be powerful. He wants to buy politicians, just like he thinks they do.

""At worst, given the right impetus, the coin of philo-Semitic anti-Semitism can easily be flipped, and all those formerly positive stereotypes can be weaponized against Jews."" Jonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League tweeted: In a written statement, Aaron Keyak, former head of the National Jewish Democratic Council, condemned Trump's remarks.

2019-10-15	New York Times (Online)	Rich Kids Can Spare Some of Their Inheritance	txt-opeds/2305522440.xml.txt	A tax on inherited money or property — unlike wealth or estate taxes — would be hard for even the fanciest accountants to shake. In America, if you play by the rules, working to earn a living and saving to provide for the future, taxes take a piece of your earnings. If you win a state lottery, you owe tax. But if you get lucky in the lottery of life and land an inheritance, you owe no federal tax. That isn’t fair, is it? Extending the federal tax code to include inheritances would end that inequity. Inheritance taxes — regulated differently in the states that have them — are a levy paid by a person who inherits money or property of a person who has died.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But now it arguably exist only in name. As recently as 1976 the estate tax applied to more than 7 percent of all descendants at a top rate of 70 percent. In 2019, however, just 0.07 percent of all descendants will owe any estate tax, a 99 percent decrease. Successive increases in the estate tax exemption over the last political generation have let all but the wealthiest — and those who neglect to consult lawyers and accountants — escape estate tax almost entirely. Ed McCaffery, a law professor at the University of Southern California, has described it as being akin to a “voluntary tax.”	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

It doubled the already generous exemption to $22.8 million from $11.4 million for couples. Congress hid much of the long-term revenue loss from the 2017 law by scheduling many provisions, including the estate tax exemption increase, to expire in 2026. It is a good bet, however, that Congress will make the exemption increase permanent. Two Democratic presidential candidates have proposals to curb wealth concentration. Senator Elizabeth Warren proposes an annual tax on net wealth — assets over $50 million would be taxed at 2 percent; assets assessed to be over $1 billion would face an extra 1 percent. Senator Bernie Sanders wants an even larger wealth tax, which he estimates would yield roughly twice as much revenue as Ms. Warren’s plan. Mr. Sanders also has a plan that would cut today’s estate tax exemption — to a still-generous $7 million for couples — and raise today’s flat 40 percent rate to a range of 45 percent to 77 percent, with the highest rate applicable only to the estates of billionaires.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

A dozen or so countries used to have wealth taxes, although none at rates approaching those Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders seek. And all but six countries have effectively abandoned them. One reason is that a broad wealth tax can work only if all or most assets of every potentially taxable person are valued every year. That is a Sisyphean task under the best of circumstances. It would be an impossible challenge in the United States, where chronically underfunded tax administrators are already unable to prevent hundreds of billions of income tax dollars from being lost each year to evasion.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

But the political obstacles are formidable. Opponents have successfully branded it a “death tax,” arousing primal instincts against adding an economic penalty to a time of emotional pain and loss. And so estate taxes continue to poll badly, even though an exceptional few people face them. Fortunately, there is an alternative: an inheritance tax. This is how it would work: Cumulative inheritances (over a lifetime exempt amount), plus gifts (over an annual exempt amount), would be taxed.

That yield is 2.5 times greater than the estate tax is estimated to yield if the exemptions introduced by the 2017 tax cuts remain in place after 2025.

But that just isn’t so for most bequeathed property. According to data compiled by the Federal Reserve, most inheritances consist of gains on financial assets or on businesses that were never taxed and under current law never will be. Another major advantage of this tax is that it creates an incentive to divide estates among multiple heirs by reducing tax liabilities. And for society, splitting estates modestly reduces the concentration of wealth — and of its attendant economic and political power — a primary goal of any of these reforms.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But measures to narrow inequality in pretax incomes will take time to enact and even more time to take effect. Meanwhile, a little help from an inheritance tax would be welcome.

But that's something to fear, as Mr. Biden's tax proposals threaten to repeat Franklin D. Roosevelt's big mistake, which many historians blame for plunging a recovering economy back into depression. Roosevelt proposed a wealth tax in 1935, expanded it in 1936, and gave it real teeth in 1937. The federal government needed to repel the attack on the foundations of society by ""economic royalists,"" he argued. John Nance Garner, his vice president, agreed. As a congressman Garner had been forthright. ""We have got to confiscate wealth,"" he declared in 1918. By 1936 the top U.S. personal income-tax rate had been raised to 79%, with a 70% maximum estate tax. The top federal corporate tax rate, however, was only 15%. In response, wealthy Americans accumulated profits inside corporations that owned their residences and other assets.

Corporate money was subject to immediate distribution and taxed at high individual rates. In effect, these were accumulated-wealth taxes, imposed at precisely the wrong time. The year also saw the introduction of a 1% Social Security tax on the first $3,000 of wages. The economic pain was swift and severe. The Dow Jones Industrial Average crashed to 114 on Nov. 24, 1937, from 190 on Aug. 14, a 40% decline. Gross domestic product fell by more than 5% between 1937 and 1938. Unemployment, roughly 12% in May 1937, climbed to 20.7% in April 1939.

But taxes, particularly the Revenue Act's undistributed profits tax, were the trigger. Without much warning, businesses and individuals had to raise large amounts of cash quickly by cutting back on workers and investments to pay taxes that would be coming due. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Byron Harrison was convinced that the tax had proved harmful and enacted a phased reduction beginning in 1938. Today the U.S. economy is recovering from a great crash, as it was before Roosevelt's tax onslaught. Unfortunately, Mr. Biden doesn't seem to have learned the right lessons. Should he win in November, he proposes to cancel the Trump tax cuts, raising the top federal income-tax rate back to 39.6%, and raise the corporate income tax from 21% to 28%.

Entin, then president of the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, told a congressional committee that the ""income tax is heavily biased against saving and investment"" and that the ""burden of higher taxes on capital formation falls largely on labor in the form of lower wages and hours worked."" As in 1937, the effect of Mr. Biden's proposals would be to draw funds out of the economy to pay taxes, discourage new investment, hurt wages and hours worked, and discourage recognizing capital gains. Mr. Biden's plan isn't the only tax increase circulating around the Democratic Party. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has proposed 2% and 6% wealth taxes on assets valued more than $50 million and $1 billion, respectively.

The Democratic Party platform calls for raising estate taxes ""back to the historical norm."" It isn't clear what that means, but a 55% top rate—up from 40% now—with a greatly reduced exemption is often discussed in liberal policy circles. Proposals to repeal the ""step-up in basis"" for inherited assets could tax the gain once more, on sale by the heirs, resulting in multiple taxation. Not every tax proposal I've outlined will ultimately be enacted. But pass enough of them, and you can expect a disastrous result. Even though Democratic politicians will claim to only target the superrich, a deluge of tax increases can send the whole economy right back to the dumps. As in 1937, today America's economic recovery is fragile. A campaign against the 1%—the new ""economic royalists""—would risk repeating FDR's mistake.	6	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren thinks millionaires and billionaires are too rich and has introduced legislation to tax away some of their wealth. Her Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act of 2021 would levy a 2% annual tax on net wealth above $50 million and an additional 1% above $1 billion. But the biggest beneficiaries would be foreign billionaires. According to estimates conducted for Ms. Warren by University of California-Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, only about 100,000 families, or ""less than 1 out of 1,000,"" would pay the tax, which they estimate would raise ""around $3 trillion over the ten-year budget window 2023-2032, of which $0.4 trillion would come from the billionaire 1% surtax.""	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The model showed that despite being a massive tax, raising nearly $300 billion a year, the tax had only a modest impact on gross domestic product. How can that be? The model predicted that wealthy U.S. citizens would sell their assets at fire-sale prices to pay the tax. Because the U.S. is an open economy, many of these assets would be bought by foreign investors at the discounted prices. Thus, while a wealth tax wouldn't shrink the U.S. economy much, it would change who owns U.S. assets. What Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and Mark Zuckerberg sell, Jack Ma, Carlos Slim and the sultan of Brunei might buy—and they'd be exempt from the U.S. wealth tax.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Many European countries abandoned their wealth taxes because their rich citizens moved to countries that didn't levy such taxes. Since 1996, the number of European nations with a wealth tax has dwindled to four from 14. The Warren bill would attempt to discourage wealthy American from renouncing their citizenship by imposing a 40% exit tax. While some rich families could decide they can live comfortably abroad with the remaining 60% of a $100 billion fortune, others may stay home and simply liquidate some of their assets to pay the tax. But if foreign investors snap up those assets at fire-sale prices, it still puts those assets out of reach of the U.S. wealth tax. Either way the tax has defeated its purpose.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Primary and general-election voters may disagree.	txt-opeds/2275105177.xml.txt	The financial markets last week went into a temporary seizure on signs that maybe, just maybe, a recession is rolling in. Trade tensions are growing, the Chinese economy is slowing, Germany actually reported a slight economic contraction. And the American economy, while doing well overall, is nearly as stimulated as it can be already and susceptible to being dragged down by this international undertow. So, let's assume there is a recession during the 2020 election season that already is dawning. What are the political consequences? Obviously, a recession would be bad for President Trump, who has staked his presidency on a good economy and a happy stock market, and whose re-election chances probably depend on a small sliver of independent voters who dislike him but do like the current economy.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Democratic pollster Mark Mellman notes that history doesn't provide clear guidance: ""We haven't had many nomination contests in the midst of recessions."" There are a few data points, though. Franklin Roosevelt prevailed in 1932, and he turned out to have the most aggressive economic prescription for the Depression then under way—the New Deal—although the contours of what he would propose actually weren't all that clear before he was nominated. President Harry Truman, a more moderate figure, won the nomination during an economic downturn in 1948, but he had no primary opposition. In 1960, John Kennedy won the nomination amid a recession. He represented a big generational change, but probably the more moderate figure in policy terms when compared with Adlai Stevenson.	2	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

In 1992, the centrist Bill Clinton won the nomination, in part because Democratic voters saw him as best able to beat incumbent President George H.W. Bush. But, as Mr. Mellman notes, Mr. Clinton was, in addition to being a centrist, also the candidate best able to appear concerned about the victims of recession: ""Clinton also cornered the empathy market."" And in 2008, Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton. Mr. Obama sat slightly to the left of Mrs. Clinton on the ideological scale.

In the current Democratic primary-season race, Mr. Biden and Mrs. Warren probably present the best proxies for the two kinds of candidates. Mr. Biden offers what is today a pretty standard Democratic economic prescription: Reverse the 2017 tax cuts for corporations and the wealthiest Americans, tighten up capital-gains tax breaks, raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, strengthen workers' rights. Mrs. Warren offers a harsher critique of the current state of capitalism, and a kind of unified theory of how to take power away from corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Among other things, she would impose a new tax on corporate profits and a wealth tax on the richest American households, and use the proceeds to pay for education, health care and climate-change programs. She has called for breaking up big technology companies, including Amazon, giving workers a voice in corporate governance, and providing taxpayers an equity stake in companies that profit from government-funded research.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

The question is whether, in a time of distress, voters are more likely to flee to a safe harbor or see trouble as a rationale for shaking things up.

I’d gotten to know Hardwick and concluded he was an interesting man with an open mind, and a good bellwether for how centrist Americans view the election. I’ve never had much time for telephone interviews for the simple reason that you don’t know much about anybody until you look them in the eye. I’d spent time with Hardwick. The first requisite for understanding is an open mind. At least it was. Today, I’m not sure. At 78, Hardwick’s easy to stereotype as just another old white guy.

I fear for the Republic if he is re-elected. Still, I find the almost complete inability of opponents of Trump to grapple with who supports him and why to be deeply alarming.

I also gave money to the family from the $15 a week which I earned, good for a kid in the mid-1950s.” Hardwick’s break came when Wonder Bread supported a new program at Florida State University that granted degrees in baking science and management, and chose to jump-start it with scholarships to four children of employees.

There are plenty of serious long-term risks to our prosperity, including a declining birthrate, national debt north of $23 trillion, the erosion of the global free-trade consensus, threats to the political independence of the Federal Reserve, and the popularization of preposterous economic notions such as Modern Monetary Theory.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

What would work? Smart infrastructure spending. New taxes on carbon offset by tax cuts on income and saving. Modest increases in taxes on the wealthy matched to the promise of a balanced budget. What these proposals lack in progressive ambition, they make up in political plausibility and the inherent appeal of modesty.

But millions of ordinary Americans see it, and they won’t vote for a candidate who emboldens and empowers woke culture. The Democrat who breaks with that culture, as Clinton did in 1992 over Sister Souljah and Obama did in October over “cancel culture,” is the one likeliest to beat Trump. Finally, the winning Democrat will need to make Trump’s presidency seem insignificant rather than monumental — an unsightly pimple on our long republican experiment, not a fatal cancer within it.

In other words, the media finds it hard to judge candidates through the vantage of their sturdy base of supporters but instead assesses them on criteria important to the media (e.g. gaffes). Hmm, haven't we seen this movie before? This precise problem in 2016 hobbled media outlets' coverage and understanding of then-candidate Donald Trump's appeal to his base. In properly tabulating his gaffes, inaccuracies and lies, they failed to appreciate what his actual appeal to his base was and why these factors were irrelevant.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Among progressives favoring other candidates? Sure. This doesn't mean Biden's gaffes won't slowly erode his appeal or that the media should ignore these comments, but they should not substitute their own evaluation for those who are voting for him, particularly older African American voters. These voters are using an entirely different set of criteria (like familiarity, loyalty to President Barack Obama, emotional connection) to assess him. The next time media outlets swarm after a rambling monologue by Biden, they should speak to voters to whom he appeals before warning of an impending collapse.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

What happens when a few suffer huge stock losses or the real estate market plummets?).

Critical African American voters are unmoved by Warren's 101 plans. The conventional wisdom is that African American voters just don't know her. That's certainly a possibility (although insulting insofar as it assumes ignorance on behalf of very engaged voters), but maybe they should be asked. Why doesn't Warren impress them?

None of this assumes intentional bias, but the most valuable lesson of 2016 may have been that, to truly understand what's going on in a campaign, you have to view events from the perspective of the majority of Americans who are not college educated and from critical segments of the party's coalition.

In that time, a funny thing has happened: Mr. Biden started at the front of the pack and has stayed right there.

Among the ""punditry class…the view was that his best day would be his first day in the race,"" says Jim Kessler, executive vice president for policy at Third Way, an organization of moderate Democrats. It is very early, of course, and those potential flaws could yet prove fatal. But for now, the buoyancy of Joe Biden raises the question: What is he telling us about the Democratic Party? Four things come to mind: —Democrats may not have moved as far left as widely thought. Many observers put together the very real energy among the party's liberal base and the party's success in the 2018 midterm elections and concluded that the first was responsible for the second. That has emboldened the liberal wing of the party to try to push the party's agenda well to the left.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

They were centrist candidates, and represent where many Democratic and independent voters are: on the center-left. That happens to be where Mr. Biden resides as well, and it appears that is just fine with a lot of rank-and-file Democrats. There actually is some unease within the party over the most prominent candidates of the left. In Wall Street Journal/NBC News polling , 36% of Democratic primary voters say they have reservations about or are uncomfortable with Sen. Bernie Sanders, and 33% say that about Sen.

From the outset, Mr. Biden has declared flatly that the 2020 race is above all about beating Mr. Trump—and that he is the candidate with the gravitas to do that. That turns to have been smart positioning. As it happens, Mr. Trump, by directing so much of his Twitter fire at Mr. Biden, actually seems to be helping him make this case, by suggesting he is the Democrat the president considers the biggest threat. —As a result of this Trump focus, this election may be more about values than ideology. Starting with his announcement video, Mr. Biden's message, implicit and explicit, has been that Mr. Trump's values and behavior, more than the policy debate, are the real issues in the 2020 campaign.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Mr. Biden will have his own policy proposals, of course—he rolled out a big just a few days ago—but this approach still represents a calculated gamble. It is also a contrast with the approaches of Mr. Sanders and, especially, Ms. Warren, who has begun to gain traction with a series of detailed liberal policy proposals—a , a corporate tax, student-debt forgiveness. —The idea of working with Republicans isn't anathema to Democratic voters.

Let me qualify that: Biden is moderate in many ways, in vision and inclination. But the policy plans he has laid out as part of his campaign are much more progressive than most anyone seems to realize. The latest evidence: the tax plan he just released. The coverage it's receiving has tended toward ""Biden releases tax plan much less ambitious than what Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders propose.""

The plan's main features: End the preferential treatment of investment income for those making more than $1 million a year. Right now, you pay higher taxes on wage income (money you get by working) than on investment income (money you get when your money makes you more money).

Institute a 15 percent minimum corporate tax, to prevent corporations from using loopholes to reduce their tax bills to nothing. Raise the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent, where it was before the Trump tax cuts. Cap the amount of deductions the wealthy can take. There are a few other proposals (here's a good rundown), but those are the most significant ones. It's true that it doesn't contain the kind of wealth tax that Warren and Sanders have proposed. And as Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute pointed out to me, it does accept some features of the Obama-era tax code as the limits of what you can do, like precisely a 39.6 percent top rate (when he could have proposed 40 percent or 50 percent).	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Which tells us that the ""moderate"" position on taxes, as on other issues, has moved significantly to the left. You can make a direct comparison with health care. When Biden was vice president, single-payer health care was considered something of a fringe idea in the Democratic Party, advocated by people like Sanders but not taken too seriously. Then it moved to the heart of the party's debate on health care, the result of which was that a robust public option became the moderate position.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

This tax plan is very similar.

Now they're in Biden's campaign tax plan, which will necessarily be the starting point for legislation if he becomes president. That brings them a giant step closer to reality. The entire atmosphere has changed. I also spoke to Jared Bernstein, who was Biden's chief economic adviser when he was vice president. (Bernstein did not have any role in crafting this plan.) He argued that in part because of a reaction to increasing regressive Republican tax policies and in part because of the prominence of more ambitious proposals such as a wealth tax, ideas about what Democrats should or can do have shifted to the left.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-12-05	The Washington Post (Online)	Joe Biden’s surprisingly liberal tax plan	txt-opeds/2322026207.xml.txt	So a reasonably progressive plan like this one would be able to pass through Congress if Democrats took control, which means winning the support of the most conservative Democratic senators, like Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema. ""When I go through this list,"" Bernstein said, ""I see a lot of stuff that I think the marginal Democratic senator would be okay with."" The ""moderate"" position on taxes among Democrats has now become not only increasing them on the wealthy, but also doing in ways that could make the tax system substantially more fair and provide significant funding for social programs — ways that were considered pipe dreams just a few years ago. Even if you think Biden's plan doesn't go far enough, that's reason to be pleased.	6	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The Post article claimed that Elizabeth Warren’s plan to introduce an annual wealth tax relies on a set of “assumptions that defy a long history of U.S. policymaking”: namely, “that the country’s wealthiest taxpayers won’t find ways to evade the targeted tax hike she proposes.” [Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.] But this claim is wrong, too.

Lobbyists who represent the wealthy like the argument because it lets them claim that there’s no point in trying. And journalists find the argument alluring because it has a ring of tough skepticism, and we journalists love to present ourselves as tough skeptics. In this case, though, it’s important to be skeptical about the skepticism. Over the last few decades, the total federal tax rate paid by the very rich has tended to hover between 30 percent and 40 percent.

It shows that for much of the 20th century, total taxes on the very wealthy were much higher than they are now. Before World War II, the average rate hovered around 70 percent.

The top marginal rate has plummeted. Taxes on stock holdings have declined, too. Perhaps nothing has mattered more than the erosion of the estate tax, through a combination of a lower rate and an increased threshold for paying the tax. These policy changes have helped turbocharge economic inequality. Is it possible to tax the wealthy too heavily and damage the economy? Yes. I don’t think the top marginal tax rate should be 91 percent, as it was in the 1950s. But it’s a very, very long way from 91 percent today. It’s only 37 percent, which is too low.

This year’s campaign offered the prospect of transformational change, with a Democratic nominee who was more liberal than any in more than a half-century.

It’s an old problem, one that has long undermined left-wing movements in this country. They have often prioritized purity over victory. They wouldn’t necessarily put it these terms, but they have chosen to lose on their terms rather than win with compromise. You can see this pattern today in the ways that many progressive activists misread public opinion.

Even Biden’s platform is strikingly liberal. But if progressives aren’t satisfied being influential runners-up, I would suggest three broad principles. First, don’t become PINOs (progressives in name only). Decide on a few core ways in which you think moderate Democrats are wrong, and stake out different positions. Second, stop believing your own spin. Analyze public opinion objectively. Acknowledge when a progressive position brings electoral costs. Finally, start testing some new political strategies. A single break with orthodoxy can send a larger signal. It can make a candidate look flexible, open-minded, less partisan and more respectful of people with different views.	7	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

At least since Adam Smith and his famous B’s (“It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest.”), a fundamental premise of economics has been that financial incentives are the primary driver of human behavior. Over the last few decades, this faith in the power of economic incentives led policymakers in the United States and elsewhere to focus, often with the best of intentions, on a narrow range of “incentive-compatible” policies.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-10-26	New York Times (Online)	Economic Incentives Don’t Always Do What We Want Them To	txt-opeds/2308851394.xml.txt	This is unfortunate, because economists have somehow managed to hide in plain sight an enormously consequential finding from their research: Financial incentives are nowhere near as powerful as they are usually assumed to be. We see it among the rich. No one seriously believes that salary caps lead top athletes to work less hard in the United States than they do in Europe, where there is no cap. Research shows that when top tax rates go up, tax evasion increases (and people try to move), but the rich don’t work less. The famous Reagan tax cuts did raise taxable income briefly, but only because people changed what they reported to tax authorities; once this was over, the effect disappeared.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-10-26	New York Times (Online)	Economic Incentives Don’t Always Do What We Want Them To	txt-opeds/2308851394.xml.txt	We see it among the poor. Notwithstanding talk about “welfare queens,” 40 years of evidence shows that the poor do not stop working when welfare becomes more generous. In the famous negative income tax experiments of the 1970s, participants were guaranteed a minimum income that was taxed away as they earned more, effectively taxing extra earnings at rates ranging from 30 percent to 70 percent, and yet men’s labor hours went down by less than 10 percent. More recently, when members of the Cherokee tribe started getting dividends from the casino on their land, which made them 50 percent richer on average, there was no evidence that they worked less.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-10-26	New York Times (Online)	Economic Incentives Don’t Always Do What We Want Them To	txt-opeds/2308851394.xml.txt	And it is true of everyone else as well — tax incentives do very little. For example, in famously “money-minded” Switzerland, when people got a two-year tax holiday because the tax code changed, there was absolutely no change in the labor supply. In the United States, economists have studied many temporary changes in the tax rate or in retirement incentives, and for the most part the impact of labor hours was minimal. Nor do people slack off if they are guaranteed an income: The Alaska Permanent Fund, which, since 1982, has handed out a yearly dividend of about $5,000 per household, has had no adverse impact on employment.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-10-26	New York Times (Online)	Economic Incentives Don’t Always Do What We Want Them To	txt-opeds/2308851394.xml.txt	On the flip side, when jobs vanish and the local economy collapses, we cannot count on people’s desire to seek out a better life to smooth things out. The United States population is surprisingly immobile now. Seven percent of the population used to move to another county every year in the 1950s. Fewer than 4 percent did so in 2018. The decline started in 1990 and accelerated in the mid-2000s, precisely at the time when the industries in some regions were hit by competition from Chinese imports. When jobs disappeared in the counties that were producing toys, clothing or furniture, few people looked for jobs elsewhere. Nor did they demand help to move or to retrain — they stayed put and hoped things would improve. As a result, one million jobs were lost and wages and purchasing power fell in those communities, setting off a downward spiral of blight and hopelessness. Marriage rates and fertility fell, and more children were born into poverty.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

We encountered this mismatch firsthand, when, in the fall of 2018, we (along with the economist Stefanie Stantcheva) conducted a survey of 10,000 Americans. We asked half of them what they thought someone should do if he or she were unemployed and a job was available 200 miles away. Sixty-two percent said the person should move. Fifty percent also said that they expected at least some people to stop working if taxes went up, and 60 percent thought that Medicaid beneficiaries are discouraged from working by the lack of a work requirement. Forty-nine percent answered yes when asked whether “many people” would stop working if there were a universal basic income of $13,000 a year with no strings attached.	5	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-10-26	New York Times (Online)	Economic Incentives Don’t Always Do What We Want Them To	txt-opeds/2308851394.xml.txt	But here is the twist: When we asked the other half of our sample the very same questions in reference to themselves, we got very different responses. Only 52 percent said they would move for a job, and this fell to 32 percent of those who were actually unemployed. Seventy-two percent of them declared that an increase in taxes would “not at all” lead them to stop working. Thirteen percent of respondents said they would probably work less if they received Medicaid without a work requirement; 12 percent said they would stop working if there were a universal basic income. In other words, “Everyone else responds to incentives, but I don’t.”	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-10-26	New York Times (Online)	Economic Incentives Don’t Always Do What We Want Them To	txt-opeds/2308851394.xml.txt	If it is not financial incentives, what else might people care about? The answer is something we know in our guts: status, dignity, social connections. Chief executives and top athletes are driven by the desire to win and be the best. The poor will walk away from social benefits if they come with being treated like a criminal. And among the middle class, the fear of losing their sense of who they are and their status in the local community can be an extraordinarily paralyzing force. The trouble is that so much of America’s social policy has been shaped by three principles that ignore these facts; to fix it we need to start from there.	7	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

In the fantasy world where most economic policy conversations about trade shocks and technological innovations take place, people quickly adjust to those changes — workers move smoothly from making clothes in North Carolina to folding clothes in New York or selling clothes online. But in the real world, it is unreasonable to expect markets to always deliver outcomes that are just, acceptable — or even efficient.

(After all, it was under Bill Clinton that “welfare as we know it” was ended.) Government intervention is necessary to help people move when it makes sense, but also, sometimes, to stay in place without losing their livelihoods and their dignity. The success of the populist agenda came from casting the working class as the victims of a war waged against them and offering them the ersatz protection of various “walls.” To counter that, policymakers must acknowledge that those who struggle economically are, in a sense, society’s fallen heroes, and that we need to treat them as such.	9	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Since 1974, the Trade Adjustment Assistance program has offered workers displaced by international trade extended unemployment benefits and up to $10,000 in education credit to help them retrain. The few people who had access to it were indeed more likely to end up in better jobs — in the 10 years after losing their jobs, workers who benefited from T.A.A. earned $50,000 more than those who did not. But as a federal program it remains minuscule — regions most affected by trade got a paltry extra 23 cents per head in T.A.A. money every year, compared with $549 in lost income.	10	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-10-26	New York Times (Online)	Economic Incentives Don’t Always Do What We Want Them To	txt-opeds/2308851394.xml.txt	T.A.A. could be made much more generous, both in its coverage and in the benefits it offers. Like the G.I. Bill, it could offer full tuition at public universities, up to a cap of several thousand dollars a month, and a housing stipend; in addition, there would be generous unemployment benefits, especially in the most severely affected counties. Perhaps more controversially, a second idea would be the equivalent of a Marshall Plan for the affected regions, with significant subsidies for firms to keep older workers employed. Third, we should not be unduly scared of raising taxes to pay for these projects. There is no evidence that it would disrupt the economy. This is, of course, a touchy subject politically: The idea of raising taxes on anyone but the very rich is not popular. So we should start with raising the rates on top income and adding a wealth tax, as many have proposed. The key then would be to link the added revenue to efforts like the ones we describe above, which would serve to slowly restore the legitimacy of the government’s efforts to help those in need. This will take time, but we have to start somewhere — and soon.	11	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Having hit a peak of $142 billion in September 2021, his net worth stood at roughly $38 billion on Thursday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. And while several tech moguls have suffered big paper losses in the current market tumult (including Post owner Jeff Bezos), Mr. Zuckerberg's 73 percent decrease appears to be the largest. We'll leave market commentary, and judgments about Mr. Zuckerberg's expensive investments in virtual reality, to others. On matters of public policy, though, the episode should not be allowed to pass without noting its implications for how Americans think about taxing wealth. Specifically, it confirms the folly of plans, such as those offered by progressive Democrats, that would claim a certain percentage of ultra-rich households' net worth each year. And, conversely, it confirms the wisdom of the existing system, which generally taxes the profits people make when they sell assets.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposed a 2 percent annual levy on household net worth above $50 million — with an extra 1 percent on fortunes larger than $1 billion. This was premised on the notion that unrealized capital gains do not exist just on paper, but are actually a form of income, in part because wealthy individuals can borrow against them to finance their — sometimes lavish — lifestyles. The White House went so far as to publish an analysis last year claiming that the 400 richest families in the United States only pay 8.2 percent of their income in taxes — if you consider unrealized gains as income.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2022-10-30	The Washington Post (Online)	Meta’s stock plunge shows the right — and wrong — way to tax wealth	txt-opeds/2730178501.xml.txt	Mr. Zuckerberg's predicament illustrates the fallacy of this sort of thinking. If an unrealized gain is income that should be taxed, then an unrealized loss should be deductible, which in his case would undoubtedly wipe out all his individual tax liability. Of course, even in a bad year such as this one, Mr. Zuckerberg or, say, more modestly rich people who hold Meta's now-beaten-down stock, could be forced to sell to raise cash to pay the wealth tax. That, in turn, could feed a downward spiral, with negative repercussions for middle-class 401(k)s and pension funds. The progressives are right, though, that there is a need for greater wealth equality, and that tax reforms could help achieve it. Capital gains should be taxed when they are realized — that is, when an asset is sold for more than it was bought for. But the top tax rate should be higher — 37 percent, just like ordinary income, instead of 23.8 percent, as under current law. Since higher income households are far more likely to report capital rather than wage income, this would eliminate a major source of inequality. It would also reduce the economically wasteful tax-avoidance strategies through which wealthy people convert ordinary income to capital gains. And unrealized gains should be taxable by those who inherit appreciated assets; current law shields such windfalls via the ""stepped-up basis"" loophole.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

My problem is that Mr. Brooks suggests that if the “left” shows concern about the middle class and the explosion of wealth for the 1 percent, then it must forget about the poor. Most people can walk and chew gum, and concern for one doesn’t obviate concern for the other. There is a small (much too small) safety net for the poor, which the Republicans want to destroy, but the biggest decrease in wealth has come from the middle class, and that is an equal concern.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The Democratic Party has long advocated strong government, paired with the power of markets, to achieve broad economic well-being. But for the first time in the five decades I’ve been involved in Democratic policy and politics, the fundamental structure of our market-based economic system is being seriously debated. A recent Gallup poll found that a majority of young Americans have a positive view of socialism — however amorphously defined — while their opinion of capitalism has declined. This concerns me: No country has succeeded economically in the postwar era without a baseline commitment to markets. Even India and China began to see serious growth only when they moved from state control toward markets (though China today is a complicated mix of the two).	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-03-02	New York Times (Online)	Democrats, if We Remain Divided, We’ll Fall	txt-opeds/2369244532.xml.txt	Capitalism’s critics are correct that there are many critical issues — climate change,   overcoming poverty, health care costs and coverage — that markets, by their nature, will not address. Our failure to meet these challenges has led to understandable anxiety and anger in our nation and our party. But the solution is not to abandon market-based economics, which is perhaps the only way to achieve long-term, inclusive growth. The solution is to pair markets with strong and effective government that meets our challenges. We should fiercely debate the best way to do that. The Democratic Party is not bound by a rigid ideology; at its heart, it is inclusive and pragmatic. Focusing on our shared goals is Democrats’ best hope to beat President Trump in November and the only way the next Democratic president could enact his or her agenda.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-03-02	New York Times (Online)	Democrats, if We Remain Divided, We’ll Fall	txt-opeds/2369244532.xml.txt	An illustrative example of a policy area where a more cohesive approach is needed is income inequality, a concern virtually all Democrats share. Reading the coverage of the presidential primary, you could be forgiven for thinking my fellow Democrats have to choose between two stark alternatives: a wealth tax on one hand and supporting the status quo on the other. I believe there is more potential for common ground — and intellectually honest give-and-take — than the drama of the primary suggests. Finding this common ground, however, will require both sides to make concessions. For the party’s more moderate factions, that starts with recognizing that the measures Democratic presidents have been able to achieve to address income inequality have fallen short. The gap between the wealthiest 0.1 percent of Americans and the other 99.9 percent is greater than ever. To close great and growing wealth and income gaps, and to raise badly needed revenue for public investment, it’s not enough to lift the bottom up; we need to ask more of those at the top, too.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2020-03-02	New York Times (Online)	Democrats, if We Remain Divided, We’ll Fall	txt-opeds/2369244532.xml.txt	Moderate members of the Democratic Party must recognize the popular resonance of a wealth tax, even if, like me, they don’t support it. Roughly 74 percent of American voters, including a majority of Republicans, support a 2 percent wealth tax on those worth more than $50 million. When I served in government, Americans were wary of taxing the very wealthy, but public opinion — and the politics of taxation — has changed. A wealth tax is on the table. But it shouldn’t be the only option on the table. Just because the wealth tax is good politics doesn’t necessarily make it good policy. A plan to bring the top down and reduce inequality must be constitutional and administrable. There are strong reasons to believe a wealth tax is neither. A wealth tax is likely to be struck down by the Supreme Court as a direct tax not apportioned among states, as the Constitution requires. And even if it survives a legal challenge, valuation is likely to prove prohibitively challenging, and taxing illiquid assets presents serious problems.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2020-03-02	New York Times (Online)	Democrats, if We Remain Divided, We’ll Fall	txt-opeds/2369244532.xml.txt	Even those who strongly support a wealth tax must concede that other plans exist and that they ought to be part of the debate. Economists have put forward revenue-raising proposals that reduce inequality, such as raising corporate, capital gains and personal income tax rates; broadening the tax base; converting deductions to more limited credits; strengthening the estate tax (including by eliminating stepped-up basis, a tax code provision that allows heirs to minimize estate taxes); and imposing a financial transactions tax, as recently proposed by Mike Bloomberg and supported by many leading progressives. Such a tax policy agenda may not have the bumper-sticker appeal of a wealth tax, but it would be likely to raise more revenue and do more to unwind concentrated wealth — and it’s constitutional and doable.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2020-03-02	New York Times (Online)	Democrats, if We Remain Divided, We’ll Fall	txt-opeds/2369244532.xml.txt	Of course, neither wing of the Democratic Party is likely to completely sell the other on its position. What matters is that Democrats unite around shared goals, while recognizing that we may initially disagree on the steps we ought to take. Each side should treat the other as an eventual ally to be reconciled with, rather than an enemy to be demonized. The alternative is to allow those who are determined to do nothing whatsoever to reduce inequality to take advantage of a divided opposition and exacerbate our economic challenges. This is true not just when it comes to income inequality, but with all our pressing issues. The real choice Democrats face is not between the left and the center. It’s between vicious debates that yield pyrrhic victories and fail to deliver real change, or a better, more pragmatic approach to intraparty debate that gives America a chance to tackle its most pressing challenges. Let’s hope we choose the latter.	5	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Barton spoke approvingly of Warren's wealth tax. Also, she said, ""on principle I am voting for a woman."" When asked for his reasoning, Grigg nodded toward his co-worker and said, ""The same as Hannah, but less eloquent."" The two work together in the compliance department of a major bank, which is a bit jarring on first consideration — Warren, after all, got her start in politics by campaigning to make their employer much less profitable.

And for that matter, so did most of the Warren voters I've spoken to outside the state. They are successful — often very successful — but in jobs that are merely well paid and reasonably secure, rather than potential sources of fantastic wealth. They like her focus on the middle class, and agree that she is by far the smartest candidate in the race. Most often, they were first attracted to her when they saw her debate.

Heck, I don't even like Warren — I've been criticizing her academic work since long before she ran for office — and yet, I find her extremely appealing.

This election cycle has been educational for any professional who has thought that the most important qualities in a presidential candidate are abstract verbal fluency, appealing anecdotes and a penchant for producing lengthy white papers. In point of fact, these are better qualifications for a journalist than a retail politician. Warren is smart, bright enough to know that she couldn't win the election by winning the hearts and minds of people who attended selective colleges. She has been doggedly trying to broaden beyond that natural constituency since the day she decided to run. It's why she tried to outflank Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to the left on so many issues.

For all of the left-wing rhetoric, her campaign platform remained too transparently focused on those core professional voters. Over the past two months, I've spoken to a number of 2016 Sanders voters who briefly became Warren-curious before deciding that her commitment to progressivism was insincere. They opted for the hippie who spent 50 years agitating for major wealth redistribution, rather than the strait-laced teacher who clawed her way to a tenured professorship at Harvard Law School. Her outreach to racial and sexual minorities may have failed for a different reason: The vulnerable often think they have to focus first and foremost on electability, rather than policy. I spoke to a lot of people in Utah who said their main priority was unseating President Trump come November. Such as Robert Simbe, a program coordinator for an organization that helps immigrants becomes citizens, and an immigrant himself.

If you had any question before Tuesday night’s debate about which Democratic presidential candidate is effectively the front-runner, the first half-hour answered it. Pete Buttigieg went after Elizabeth Warren, wondering why she was so intent on abolishing private health insurance and suggesting that her stance would dangerously intensify political polarization in America. Amy Klobuchar went after Warren, describing her Medicare for All plan as one big fat Republican talking point and Warren as a fantasist peddling “a pipe dream.” Bernie Sanders went after her — well, sort of — by correctly noting her repeated refusal to admit what he already had, which is that Medicare for All would require a tax increase not just for affluent Americans but also for the middle class.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

All of it was, in fact, a great compliment to Warren. During both the opening stretch of the debate and subsequent ones, her prescriptions were the point of reference, her priorities set the terms of the discussion, and she was the candidate to whom the debate’s moderators kept returning so that she could respond to her rivals’ invocations of her. And she stayed cool and confident under fire, sounding more grateful for the spotlight than fearful of the microscope. It was, for the most part, a fine performance. But it was also, at first, an exasperating one.

If that’s the case, why not be explicit about the arithmetic and own it? If there’s nothing to hide from, why hide from it?

One is that Warren’s rivals jousted with her more than before — on health care, on her “wealth tax,” on the way she speaks about corporations and the richest Americans. That was crucial, because it brought to the surface questions about her ideas that are best recognized and evaluated now, so that Democratic voters can figure out if she’s their surest bet against President Trump. It was also important because it gave her a better chance than the previous, gentler debates did to show what she’s made of.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

She also displayed flashes of charm, most memorably after Joe Biden patronized her, taking some of the credit for the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that she more than anyone made happen. He volunteered that he, as vice president, was responsible for building the necessary support in Congress. “I got you votes,” he said. “I am deeply grateful,” she responded, “to President Obama.” It was a dexterous and devastating way of observing how readily Biden claims the accomplishments of an administration in which he played second fiddle.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The latter group of candidates traffic in measured remedies that are more obviously attainable, prioritizing imperfect, incremental change over grandly transformative proposals that face hurdles galore and very long odds. In their estimation — in mine, too — that’s probably the safer agenda with which to do battle against Trump, whose ouster eclipses all other goals.

Klobuchar chimed in: “I want to give a reality check here to Elizabeth, because no one on this stage wants to protect billionaires. Not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.” She was referring to Tom Steyer, who was making his Democratic-debate debut. Warren said that she had nothing against billionaires per se and wasn’t in the demonization business. She was in the justice business. And with her final remarks, she sought to underscore that with praise for a prominent Republican ally of the first President Bush.

Apart from that odd exchange with Warren, Biden had a decent night, partly because he was given, and took advantage of, several opportunities to stress that he was more prepared for the presidency than anyone else and that the post-Trump era called for someone who wouldn’t have a steep learning curve. The repair work must begin immediately. Buttigieg made clear that what he offers, at the tender age of 37, is a truly fresh perspective. He had a superb night, because he embraced a role as Warren’s inquisitor and because several supremely eloquent remarks about foreign policy — in particular, about Trump’s withdrawal of American troops from Syria — allowed him to project a command and maturity that some voters needed to see to consider him seriously.	8	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

As for Harris, she had strong moments, but they were neither strong nor frequent enough to alter her fortunes. This was the most crowded televised presidential debate ever, with 12 candidates, so I’d need the column equivalent of “War and Peace” to appraise all of them.

Scientists cannot say how much climate change factored into a particular natural disaster until they conduct an attribution study that calculates the extent to which global warming contributed. But now, all the same natural forces that previously conspired to produce such events are doing so within a system that human beings have primed with more energy. A common analogy is to a basketball court: Some good players could always dunk, given the right circumstances, but dunking would occur more often if the floor were raised. The ongoing misery in the United States, Germany and China reflects exactly the sorts of calamities that boosting global temperatures promises to make more common, more extreme and more deadly.

First, we must reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving global warming.

But I think the tendency to blame any failure by any woman politician on misogyny is misguided and possibly harmful to the advancement of women as a whole. If every failure is the result of misogyny, then there is no reason to consider the candidate’s own actions, choices or other circumstances. There are many reasons Ms. Warren didn’t do better.

Speaking as an old, educated, white, professional woman, I can tell you that her loss was not only anticipated, but welcomed by many Democrats like me. We are glad she lost the primaries because we knew she could not have won in November. She suffered from the same flaws as Hillary Clinton — most fundamentally, the belief that if only a woman works harder than anyone else, she will get rewarded with the presidency. The belief that the election is a contest over who has prepared the most elaborately detailed plans.

However, when Senator Warren veered to the left to endorse universal health care with no real idea how to pay for it and a 2 percent wealth tax, she lost the majority of moderate Democrats.

Throughout this primary season, I have been continually surprised by my women friends who liked Elizabeth Warren but thought that a woman couldn’t win against Donald Trump or that the conservative portions of the country wouldn’t support a woman. So, it would seem, the only problem these women had with Elizabeth Warren was that she was a woman. They could have easily supported a man with the same qualifications and same ideas.

What Democrats want most is to beat President Trump. To that end, they obsess over whether energizing progressives or persuading swing voters is more important; how the electorate would react to a woman or person of color running against Trump; and whether a candidate who is too young or too old presents a risk. At some point in these conversations, someone usually steps in to say Democrats don't need to worry: The primary is a Darwinian process. Whoever survives is, by definition, the most electable candidate. But primary voters often pick candidates with glaring, foreseeable general-election weaknesses over stronger contenders.

In 2016, both parties blew it. On the Republican side, Donald Trump deprived his opponents of media oxygen by generating scandals, championed immigration restrictionism and won against a divided field by playing to his blue-collar white base. But his primary strengths were general-election liabilities. Trump generated controversy on a near-daily basis, lost debates and ended up being the least popular candidate in the history of presidential elections. Though Trump won the 2016 election, it wasn't pretty. He lost the popular vote despite drawing an unpopular opponent and having the deus ex machina of the Comey letter swing late polls in his favor. The 2016 election shouldn't have been tough for the Republicans, but Trump barely squeaked by. A more conventional politician — such as Marco Rubio, who got more votes in Florida than Trump on Election Day 2016, or Scott Walker, who won in Wisconsin three times — likely would have assembled a larger coalition and actually won the popular vote.	1	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But the political muscle that allowed her to clear the field was also a problem. Trump portrayed her as a creature of ""the swamp."" And she was dogged, fairly or unfairly, by ethical questions about her email servers and other controversies. She ended the election as the second-most unpopular presidential candidate in history and failed to carry the swing states she needed to secure the presidency. Democrats are working with a stronger field than they had in 2016 — there was only one or two truly plausible presidents in that group (Clinton and Sanders), and there are at least half a dozen this time around.

Harris have focused on building strong ties with black voters and either could reenergize Obama voters who stayed home in 2016 (though testing the waters with the extremely unpopular idea of reparations for slavery might harm them with the broader electorate). I've been bearish on Beto O'Rourke since he entered the national political arena, but his almost-victory in Texas in 2018 should count for something.

But this new thinking seems starkly different from the party's reform efforts of the past three decades. The wonky proposals of the Clinton-Obama era were pragmatic and incremental, and they mixed market incentives with government action. Today, we have big, stirring ideas — and that could be the problem.

Perhaps this casual attitude toward facts explains the way that she and many others on the left have misrepresented the deal that New York offered Amazon to bring a new headquarters there. She claimed New York was going to give away $3 billion to Amazon  that could have been used to pay for schoolteachers and subways. But as Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) explained, ""This was a deal that was going to bring $27 billion in revenue to the state and city for things like public education, mass transit, affordable housing. And that $3 billion that [Amazon would receive in] incentives was only after we were getting the jobs and getting the revenue."" Moreover, $2.5 billion of those incentives were not specially crafted for Amazon, but rather were preexisting tax credits that it would have qualified for.

This was a chance for New York to gain leadership in the technology industry, further diversify its economy away from real estate and finance, and add new dynamism to the sometimes-forgotten borough of Queens. For all those who worried about Amazon crowding out low-income housing, a community activist smartly predicted to me what will happen to that part of Long Island City. Come the next recession, he explained, real estate developers will snap up the land, turn it into luxury condos, and take a 25-year tax break in return for reserving a smattering of apartments for the ""middle class"" (meaning people earning $125,000).

Or consider the tax proposals being tossed around on the left, including a wealth tax championed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). I understand the appeal of tapping into those vast accumulations of billionaire loot. But there is a reason nine of the 12 European countries that instituted similar taxes have repealed them in the last 25 years. They massively distort economic activity, often incentivizing people to hide assets, devalue them and create dummy corporations.

But when it comes to the 2020 presidential race, Harter's taking a different stance. The reason? Electability. Harter doesn't think Warren has what it takes to beat President Trump. When you talk to voters — or at least the sort of voters who are engaged this early in the political process — you hear over and over again variations on what Harter said. It doesn't seem to matter that, as Warren's Monday night town hall on CNN made clear, she possesses the gift of making complicated political and economic policy engaging and exciting. Nor does it matter that Americans agree with Warren's policy positions — in fact, her proposed wealth tax is so popular, half of Republicans support it. All too many simply don't think Warren can win. Again and again, I hear things like A woman can't get elected president. Trump's defined her as ""Pocahontas."" She's too liberal. She's not liberal enough. Hillary Clinton talked about policy, too.

Politico also tried to solve the puzzle, wondering late last year, if Warren could beat back the ""ghosts"" of Hillary Clinton, or would get dismissed as ""unlikable"" without the voters even giving her a chance. But the issue, I thought, watching Warren on Monday night, goes far beyond Clinton, and beyond Warren's mishandling of her claimed Native American ancestry. It's not even particularly mysterious.

With every detailed policy proposal, every fleshed-out agenda, one can almost hear Warren asking the voters for another chance. She's appealing to voters to let her walk through the threshold she declined to even try to cross in 2016. Could it happen? Well, here is the good news for Warren. Her current difficulties are far from a campaign death sentence. An early inability to gain traction need not be fatal. John Kerry revamped his campaign staff prior to the first Democratic primary in 2004, when it appeared former Vermont governor Howard Dean was gaining traction. John McCain experienced so much trouble with initial fundraising, he needed to lay off staff in 2007, before he won the GOP nomination in 2008. There's almost a year before the first voter casts so much as a ballot in the Iowa caucuses. A lot will happen before then. That gives Warren, the Democratic Party and voters time to leave 2016 behind — once and for all.

In June 2021 and in articles since, the left-wing website has published the confidential tax data of Mr. Griffin, who runs Citadel Securities, and other wealthy Americans. ProPublica used the tax data to argue that the rich don't pay enough taxes, and the first article came out when Democrats were making the case for a wealth tax.

After a pleasant several minutes of discussion Mr. Colbert told the senator that the ""most radical thing that you're proposing is Medicare for All."" The comedian then continued where friendly journalists often fear to tread: Colbert: You keep being asked in the debates: ""How are you going to pay for it?

Warren: But, here's the thing— Colbert: But, here's the thing. I've listened to these answers a few times before and I just want to make a parallel suggestion for you about how you might defend the taxes that perhaps you're not mentioning in your sentence... Isn't Medicare-for-all like public school? There might be taxes for it, but you certainly save a lot of money on sending your kids to school and do you want to live in a world where kids aren't educated?

2021-06-10	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Editorial: What to do about billionaires who pay no taxes	txt-opeds/2539553853.xml.txt	Nothing galls taxpayers as much as hearing about people with far bigger incomes who paid a lot less than they did to the Internal Revenue Service. So when ProPublica reported Tuesday that some of the richest people in America paid no income taxes at all multiple times in the mid-2000s, the revelation triggered a wave of outrage from people not so adept at tax avoidance. What’s worse, the authors contended, is that the tax burden on the richest Americans shrank as their wealth soared. But that wasn’t an apples-to-apples measure. The authors looked not just at what these billionaires collected in salary, dividends and interest, but also at the escalating value of their stock holdings — gains that are not considered taxable income until the stock is sold.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-10	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Editorial: What to do about billionaires who pay no taxes	txt-opeds/2539553853.xml.txt	To some observers, that’s a feature of the tax code, not a bug. If you tax the gain in an unsold stock’s value in good years, the IRS will have to pay refunds to those same taxpayers when their shares decline in bad years. And what about investments whose value isn’t so easy to determine, like non-fungible tokens or ownership shares in a startup that has yet to go public? Taxing gains when they are realized — when an item is sold or transferred — is far more straightforward. Still, the accumulating wealth of the taxpayers analyzed by ProPublica points to a real problem: the income and wealth inequality that has widened over the last four decades in this country. The trend has accelerated in the wake of the 2017 tax cuts championed by President Trump, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A driving force has been the rapid rise in stock values; the wealthiest 10% of households own more than 80% of the stocks.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-10	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Editorial: What to do about billionaires who pay no taxes	txt-opeds/2539553853.xml.txt	The financial chasm between the wealthiest households and the vast majority of Americans challenges the country on multiple levels, both social and economic. And policymakers should certainly try to reverse the growing inequality and narrow the gap. There are a variety of ways to do that, but like all things related to tax policy, each of the possible solutions comes with tradeoffs. The place to start would be by narrowing or eliminating the exemptions and preferences in the tax code whose benefits accrue almost exclusively to high-income taxpayers — especially people earning $5 million or more, who pay a lower share of their income in taxes than other wealthy Americans. One preference worth eliminating is the lower tax rate for capital gains; according to the Tax Policy Center, more than 90% of those gains in 2019 went to the households in the top 20% of incomes.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-06-10	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Editorial: What to do about billionaires who pay no taxes	txt-opeds/2539553853.xml.txt	Beyond that, one approach touted by progressives would be to impose a “wealth tax” that requires people with assets worth more than a certain threshold — for example, $50 million in the proposal by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Reps. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.) — to pay a percentage of that value annually. This would also be the most disruptive measure, given the potential effects on small and closely held businesses, family farms and assets that are hard to value. It’s not an unprecedented idea — versions of a wealth tax have been tried in a number of other jurisdictions — but most of the European countries that tried a wealth tax abandoned it. One reason is concerns about the tax’s effects on their economies, which would be felt by rich and poor alike. A study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development found that the wealth taxes in Europe discouraged entrepreneurship and risk taking, and consequently job creation, because they weren’t as forgiving of losses as income taxes are.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Investments that can’t be traded, such as a startup founder’s ownership shares, would be taxed when sold, with a higher rate applied to compensate for the years they went untaxed. But there are plenty of other tradeable assets that can be hard to value before they’re sold. And like a wealth tax, Wyden’s proposal could force people to sell assets in order to pay their tax bill. How that would affect the market and investment incentives is an open question.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE
2021-06-10	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Editorial: What to do about billionaires who pay no taxes	txt-opeds/2539553853.xml.txt	Proponents of taxing unrealized gains argue that the wealth isn’t just on paper. People use their investments as collateral for loans, generating potentially enormous sums that aren’t taxed (and, depending on how they’re used, may even lower the borrower’s tax liability). According to securities filings, ProPublica reported, Oracle’s billionaire chief executive, Larry Ellison, used $10 billion in company stock to support a line of credit, and Tesla’s billionaire CEO, Elon Musk, used more than $55 billion worth of company stock to secure personal loans. So why not tax gains on shares used to collateralize a loan or support some other transaction? That would hew to the logic of the current system, and wouldn’t discourage taxpayers from making investments for the long term — it would simply prevent them from generating consumable income in a way that avoids taxes. Think of it like a consumption tax that applies only to people at the top of the economic ladder. A broad tax on stock purchases and other financial transactions would also fall far most heavily on the top 20% of incomes, although the effects could ripple broadly through the economy.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-06-10	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Editorial: What to do about billionaires who pay no taxes	txt-opeds/2539553853.xml.txt	Congress should also prevent taxpayers from passing enormously valuable estates on to their heirs free from capital gains taxes by rolling back the “stepped up basis” rule, which revalues inherited properties in a way that wipes out the taxation of all prior gains. President Biden has proposed this change to help pay for his $1.8-trillion American Families Plan, with an exception for family-owned farms and businesses that the heirs continue to operate, and it’s worth making. Estate taxes are one of the two main types of wealth tax in the United States today (the other being state and local taxes on real estate and certain types of personal property), and attempts to raise them have been bitterly contested in Congress. But then, any change in the tax code would be a challenge these days. And making the current estate tax a more effective counterweight to widening income inequality would be a simpler and less disruptive step than expanding the reach of wealth taxes.	6	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Meanwhile, the Cardinals whiffed repeatedly and were eventually penalized; Joe Biden, on the other hand, let a few gently lobbed questions about his son Hunter sail by, at which point moderators just went on with the debate. In baseball, it is sometimes good to come out swinging, as it was when the beautiful Nationals heroes Juan Soto, Anthony Rendon and Howie Kendrick did so. But confusingly, many debaters also came out swinging, clearly uncertain about whether they were involved in the debate or baseball portion of the evening: Pete Buttigieg, who criticized Medicare-for-all; Amy Klobuchar, who called it a pipe dream (what people who saw the Nats play in May would have called a World Series berth); Beto O'Rourke, who thought a wealth tax was needlessly punitive.

Biden said no, even though people had been continuously making bad calls in an effort to get him thrown out, and when challenged, had said the calls were perfect. One of the frustrating things at the end of the baseball game is that even if your brave ballplayers prevail, they do not get to come out and speak exclusively for 10 to 20 minutes about how they believed and dug deep and what percents they gave, but instead an older man involved in their hiring gets to interrupt and take credit.

When President Obama considered a similar move, it would cost them billions in donations. • Treat wealthy taxpayers' capital gains as ordinary income, taxed at 39.6%. This would apply to those earning more than $1 million, and it's a huge increase on today's top capital-gains rate of 23.8%, once the ObamaCare surtax is included.

Twelve are up for re-election. If Democrats somehow sweep the field next year — if they save every incumbent, win every tossup and flip every seat that only leans Republican, they’ll have a 54-member majority. In this hypothetical majority, at least three members — Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Doug Jones of Alabama — will come from conservative, pro-Trump states. And there will be new members from competitive, Republican-leaning states like Iowa, Arizona and Georgia. A Democratic president might have 46 liberal-to-left-wing votes for her agenda. Even without the filibuster, this agenda would rest with relatively conservative Democrats like Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Sinema, Politico reports, has distanced herself from her liberal colleagues, won’t commit to supporting the Democratic nominee for president, backs the supermajority requirement for legislation — otherwise known as the legislative filibuster — and hopes to restore the supermajority requirement for judicial and executive branch nominations.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

And as much as the New Deal remains a touchstone for the left wing of the Democratic Party, it is also an important to keep in mind that the composition of Congress had as much to do with that particular heyday of American liberalism as the character of presidential leadership did. The 1935 National Labor Relations Act, to give just one example, was a signature accomplishment of the New Deal. Devised in response to profound industrial unrest, it recognized the right to strike, to organize, to form a union.

The architect was Senator Robert Wagner of New York, a longtime ally to labor and a staunch New Dealer. After the 1934 midterm elections gave Democrats a commanding majority in Congress — nearly obliterating the right wing of the Republican Party — Wagner saw a chance to act. Working closely with organized labor, Wagner and his staff went for broke.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), released a proposal for his own tax on the richest Americans, one even more sweeping than Warren's. And he has now delivered a new plan to address economic inequality aimed at corporations. While Sanders may be still be on the left of the Democratic Party, the economic proposals this campaign is producing show how much the conversation around the economy has changed among Democrats, even those who are ostensibly more moderate. Here's what Sanders is proposing: So if the median employee makes $40,000 a year and the CEO makes more than $2 million a year, the corporation would have to pay a higher tax rate.	0	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

In 2018, according to the Economic Policy Institute, the ratio of CEO to median worker's pay at top corporations last year was a remarkable 278 to 1 (or 221 to 1 depending on which measure you use to account for stock options). At some large corporations, the ratio is over 1,000 to 1.

Warren, in contrast, has a proposal that is in many ways more fundamental. She would mandate that large corporations serve the interests of all stakeholders (including their workers and the communities where they're located), not just their shareholders. And she would require that 40 percent of the seats on corporate boards be filled by people elected by employees.

Even Joe Biden, who's running as a moderate, is considering proposing a financial transactions tax on Wall Street, which used to be something advocated only by progressives like Warren and Sanders. To see what an extraordinary change this is, let's recall the tax policies of the two most recent Democratic presidents. In 1993, Bill Clinton passed a budget that included, among other things, an increase in the top income tax rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent. At the time, Republicans predicted that this would immediately plunge the United States into an outright economic cataclysm.

While it's not inaccurate to say the party has ""moved left"" in the time since, what has really happened is that Democrats have decided that it's politically safe to advocate for things that they probably supported years ago but worried wouldn't fly with the electorate. And they still might not. But with inequality at unprecedented levels and polls consistently showing that wide majorities of Americans believe the biggest problem with the tax system is that corporations and wealthy people get away without paying their fair share, the last thing Republicans probably want is to have an argument about whether we should be tougher on corporations and the wealthy.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Boskin notes that the Social Security 2100 Act, which has 210 Democratic co-sponsors, would pay for the largest benefits expansion since 1972 by raising the payroll tax almost 20 percent to 14.8 percent, and uncapping the maximum earnings subject to the tax. Then add the promised 70 percent top income tax rate, a 3 percent wealth tax, a financial transactions tax, a one-third increase in the corporate rate and increased taxation of capital gains. Boskin says the 70 percent rate, ""an average 7 percent top state personal tax rate"" and the 14.8 percent payroll tax by themselves would mean ""a 91.8 percent marginal tax rate.""

Boskin says this: Fossil fuels are essential to tillage, transportation, grain drying, manufacturing fertilizer, pesticides, farm equipment and farm electricity. Fertilizers increase U.S. wheat and corn yields 70 percent and more than 100 percent, respectively. President George W.

(14 percent) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) (11 percent) have shuffled among themselves — with Sanders as the biggest loser — and remain bunched up. Biden continues to lead in large part because he is the only one who can draw on both African Americans (usually pulling well over 30 percent in a 24-person field with two African Americans) and whites.

He might want to look at the debate as an example of ""what does not kill you makes you stronger."" In Biden's case that can play out in a couple of ways. First, a phony sense of ""electability"" is gone, but a better one has emerged. Biden is not more electable because he is a white male or even because he was President Barack Obama's vice president.

Quite simply, no one can plausibly call him ""socialist.""

Biden should ask Democratic opponents why the vast majority of Americans without a college education should subsidize the education of a minority of the population, a minority that is whiter and richer than the rest of America. He should make clear that the wealth tax is a poor way to raise revenue compared with his ideas (e.g. ending the step-up for those inheriting appreciated property and stock, narrowing the gap between rates for salary income and capital gains income). He should point out that there is no button marked ""End long wars,"" but there is a way to reduce forces in Afghanistan and transition to a counter-terrorism role.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as ""the most significant piece of legislation passed [for working people] since the 1960s."" But now comes the hard test. As Sanders admitted, the rescue plan was ""emergency"" legislation, with most of its benefits expiring within a year. Will Biden and the razor-thin Democratic majorities in Congress be able to finally bury the conservative era of market fundamentalism that has so clearly failed? It is no small surprise that Biden appears intent on making the effort. Before becoming president, the lifelong moderate typically eschewed boldness for compromise.

Far more important though is the vision — the assertion that public investment will create millions of good jobs, while addressing needs that have been starved through the conservative era. Biden's unexpected audacity comes from two places. First, he recognizes that the world has changed. What he calls the ""cascading crises"" facing America — the pandemic, economic collapse, accelerating climate catastrophe, long-overdue racial eruption — have created a ""Roosevelt moment,"" when democracy is put to the test. Second, more than ever, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party is driving the policy debate. Sanders may have lost the nomination, but his ideas have never been more popular — not only among Democrats but the broader public as well. Led by Rep.

Some reforms are obvious: Addressing the country's vast infrastructure needs makes far less sense if it doesn't fuel the transformation to renewable energy, energy efficiency and resilience. Lower prescription drug prices and investments in housing and mass transit are no brainers as well. But progressives will also push to address human infrastructure needs — what Ai-jen Poo, the head of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, calls the ""care economy."" This includes expanding home- and community-based services — a commitment Biden made in the campaign, making the ARP's child tax credit permanent, and providing universal child care with trained and professional providers, paid family and medical leave, paid vacation days and more. Providing resources for child and senior care through Medicaid offers the opportunity to meet pressing human needs while lifting the wages of providers. Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) champions ""baby bonds,"" providing every child with an investment account seeded with $1,000 with annual increases of up to $2,000 depending on income, all paid for by a marginal increase in the estate tax on the wealthiest fortunes.

Unless, that is, you reside in the Sussexes' adopted California, where lawmakers want to impose the nation's first ""wealth tax"" — an ill-timed, ill-considered scheme likely to bring Sacramento more embarrassment than revenue. California's legislature has a few frenzied days before its session ends to decide whether to adopt a proposal to impose a 0.4 percent tax on personal fortunes north of $30 million ($15 million for married taxpayers filing separately). The draft legislation looks at Californians' ""worldwide net worth"" derived from 18 categories of assets — including virtually every conceivable form of financial security, real property, offshore holdings, pension funds, farm assets, and art and collectibles, among myriad other items of value.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Elizabeth Warren wouldn't dare: Her proposed federal wealth tax, a centerpiece of her failed presidential run, began at $50 million. California's tax is also more punitive than the one proposed earlier this month by Vermont senator and avowed socialist Bernie Sanders. That bill would impose a 60 percent tax on net-wealth profits from March 18 through the end of 2020 — but only on billionaires. In California, though, sticking it to ""the rich"" is a state pastime. Two ballot measures passed in 2012 and 2016 raised taxes on incomes starting at $250,000 — not exactly aimed at plutocrats in a state where, in some places, household incomes around $240,000 are still considered ""middle class.""

For one, because it's an idea that's already been shown to fail. More than a dozen European countries already went down this road and found that a combination of clever asset management, flight abroad and intense lobbying for exemptions meant the levies didn't generate the hoped-for revenue. As a result, nearly all of these countries eventually ditched their wealth taxes. Second: One problem with national wealth taxes is the ease with which people can park their assets abroad. The Golden State, however, would be picking fights not only with other countries but also with other U.S. states. The proposed wealth tax would impose levies on citizens for up to a decade after those Californians fled to lower-tax pastures. This would not be a case of governments working across state lines, as one might expect in a manhunt. States such as Nevada, Arizona and Texas take great pleasure in poaching California's moneyed elite with promises of lower taxes and less bureaucracy. Don't expect revenuers in Austin or Carson City to do any favors for their counterparts in Sacramento.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Cash is easy to value, but what about farmland or jewelry inherited from grandma? Inevitably, the state and taxpayers are going to arrive at different estimates, and the only guaranteed winners in this scheme will be art appraisers willing to low-ball multimillionares' Monets. With deep pockets and a lot of money on the line, wealthy Californians could lawyer up and keep the state perpetually tied up in tax litigation — both delaying and lowering anticipated revenues. With all of these warnings, is the tax likely to be enacted? Democrats enjoy supermajority control of California's two legislative chambers, so the requisite two-thirds approval is easily doable. Given the state's massive budget deficit, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) may be looking at an offer he can't refuse — not when there's a rosily estimated multibillion-dollar windfall involved, and not when the tax targets some 30,400 people in a state 1,300 times that large.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

If that happens, California millionaires would be looking at a total top income tax rate of nearly 54 percent for federal and state taxes. But California lawmakers may be tempting fate. The state's revenue system already is overly dependent on millionaires and billionaires: The top 1 percent of taxpayers generate half of personal income tax receipts.

Well, perhaps they have figured out what the big things cost and don't see they are economically or politically viable. Warren's brand is truth-telling about the rich and powerful, but you simply cannot get the rich and big corporations to pay for all of it. The Medicare-for-all plan introduced by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is presumably the basis for Warren's idea — despite all her other plans, she has little specifics on health care. Sanders's plan posits a number of funding sources and specifies a premium for families (""a typical family of four earning $50,000, after taking the standard deduction, would pay a 4 percent income-based premium to fund Medicare for All — just $844 a year — saving that family over $4,400 a year. Because of the standard deduction, families of four making less than $29,000 a year would not pay this premium"").

This was all bolstered by last month's comprehensive platform announcement by Singh at the Ontario NDP convention. For Singh, the environmental plan formed only part of the pitch. It was a part of what Singh called a New Deal for People (sharing the party's acronym), aimed at uniting social, economic and environmental justice under one banner. This includes full drug decriminalization, lowering the voting age to 16, ending police racial profiling, committing to a partnership with Indigenous peoples and providing truly universal Medicare by closing gaps around access to medicine, dentistry and mental health care. All of this would be paid for by shifting away from fossil fuel subsidies and raising taxes on the richest people and corporations, including the creation of a 1 percent wealth tax on all individual wealth above 20 million Canadian dollars (just over $15 million). Thus, both on the environmental front and otherwise, Singh's NDP is offering to Canadians the boldest platform from a major party since the end of the Cold War.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

But after his strong showing in Iowa, could Bernie Sanders be the first? That's the question Democrats have to ask as Tuesday's New Hampshire primary approaches. Republicans may want to hold the Schadenfreude. The counting fiasco has muddled the Iowa results, but it seems Mr. Sanders has either finished a narrow first or a close second to former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.

The difference is that his foils are corporations and the wealthy, the classic targets of left-wing populists. The risk for his supporters and the Democratic Party is that Bernie's platform is the most explicitly left-wing since at least Henry Wallace in 1948. He wants to nationalize health insurance, eliminating 170 million private policies. He wants a $16.3 trillion Green New Deal and a $2.5 trillion housing plan, to include national rent control. He wants to cancel $1.6 trillion in student debt and ban fracking. He wants a ""wealth tax"" on individual net worth, with rates up to 8% a year.

Progressives think Mr. Trump's personal unpopularity offers a unique chance to win the White House with an agenda that yanks the country to the left.

Look at South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who sanctimoniously criticized Warren for failing to detail how her Medicare-for-all would be financed but has provided scant details on how to pay for his own health plan; it's politically safer for him to cite vague ""cost savings"" and unspecified ""corporate tax reform."" That said, it has been frustrating to watch more moderate positions be characterized as solely driven by political calculations. Many of these center-left proposals are good policies that should be defended on the merits, and not because they may (or may not) be more politically expedient.

A college education is a valuable thing, most of whose benefits still accrue to the person receiving the degree. It's okay to ask people to pay a price above zero in exchange for that sheepskin. Yes, public colleges should be cheaper — and even free for those who would otherwise be unable to attend. While the degree recipient retains most of the value of higher education, there are indeed significant spillover benefits to having a more educated populace; and as a nation, we also want all individuals to have a shot at achieving their full potential, regardless of their financial circumstances at birth.	2	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

So if there isn't an economic or a moral argument for free college for the wealthy, you know what there is?

Likewise, it isn't an abandonment of principles, or of the poor, to say you can guarantee affordable health coverage for all Americans without completely rearranging 18 percent of the economy into a single-payer plan. Yes, everyone needs health care. But not everyone needs to get it through Uncle Sam or completely for free, as Sanders's Medicare-for-all bill prescribes. Even the current Medicare program, while universal for Americans over age 65, charges premiums based on income.

If you're not familiar with these ideas, you're not alone: Whatever their policy merits,  these are all wonky, technical changes to the tax code. They're difficult to explain succinctly and clearly on the campaign trail.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is running ahead of the Democratic presidential pack in terms of policy specifics. We hope other candidates will emulate her willingness to lay out an agenda. Alas, her latest big idea — to eliminate vast quantities of student debt and make public universities tuition-free — is not a sound idea. The nation's households owe almost $1.5 trillion in student loans, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. This represents a burden on many families, which, under Ms. Warren's plan, would  disappear completely for 75 percent of them, and at least partially for 95 percent. That's because she would forgive debts up to $50,000 — just over twice the average federal student loan balance, $23,000. And she would do so for borrowers with a household income under $100,000 — some 80 percent of the population. Even borrowers earning up to $250,000 would be eligible for some relief, which would total $640 billion overall. Free college would add $600 billion or so more, for a total price tag over 10 years of $1.25 trillion.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-04-23	The Washington Post (Online)	Elizabeth Warren has the wrong answer to America’s student debt problem	txt-opeds/2213006994.xml.txt	No one can accuse Ms. Warren of thinking small. What she really needs is a better sense of proportion. Her premise seems to be that student debt is all burden and no benefit, but this is not true: It represents an investment in skill acquisition that pays substantial long-term benefits. President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers estimated this lifetime ""earnings premium"" at about $1 million over a worker with only a high school education. It's not unfair to expect people to pay back their loans out of that income. What might be unfair is debt relief to the exclusion of other priorities with wider benefits, including to people who did not go to college at all. Ms. Warren proposes a wealth tax to cover the cost, the proceeds of which would then not be available for alternative, possibly more progressive uses. In any case, default rates are actually falling slightly, according to the latest Education Department figures; 84.7 percent of borrowers were current on their obligations as of the end of 2017, according to the New York Fed.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Other Democrats have, quite properly, raised feasibility concerns about Ms. Warren's plan. ""I have to be straight with you and tell you the truth,"" Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) told a group of New Hampshire students recently, in explaining why she wouldn't match Ms. Warren's offer. For us, though, policy priority is the essential concern. Student-loan defaults are concentrated among students who attended for-profit institutions, or who accumulated low loan balances but then dropped out and were stuck paying the money back out of lower-than-anticipated earnings. Such issues are hardest for students and families of color, as Ms. Warren correctly emphasized. This calls for a targeted approach that relieves the worst financial stress of those least able to handle it, not a sweeping bailout for the middle class and above.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is being honest by conceding the middle class would need to fork over more taxes to pay for it. But now the Medicare-for-all opponents might need another argument. In an interview with CNBC's John Harwood, Sanders essentially concedes he cannot — or will not — explain how to pay for it, either. Here is the exchange: John Harwood: One of the constraints has been fiscal. Senator Warren is producing plans to pay for Medicare-for-all. You've identified revenue sources for about half of it.

You have an insane situation. Let my Wall Street friends there tell me why it makes sense. … John Harwood: But you still have more revenue to go to make it fully paid for, yes? Bernie Sanders: The fight right now is to get the American people to understand that we're spending twice as much per capita, that of course, we can pay for it.

All that I'm saying is that we have laid out a variety of options that are progressive. We'll have that debate.

That, frankly, is no different that President Trump promising in 2016 that he had a fabulous health-care plan to replace the Affordable Care Act but was not going to share what it was. I do not see the justification for this sort of politics, which tells voters the only thing standing between them and socialist nirvana is big, bad corporations, when there is no realistic plan to deliver nirvana.

Warren has several options, none of which is ideal but some of which will not sink her candidacy. First, she can adopt one of the spending schemes put forth by the Committee for a Responsible Budget. (The recommendations include ""a 32 percent payroll tax, a 25 percent income surtax, a 42 percent value-added tax, or a public premium averaging $7,500 per capita or more than $12,000 per individual who wouldn't otherwise be enrolled in Medicare, Medicaid, or [the Children's Health Insurance Program] … [as well as] more than doubling individual and corporate income tax rates, reducing federal spending by 80 percent, or increasing the national debt by 108 percent of GDP."") She will need to explain how she keeps her promise to shelter the middle class from higher total costs when ""tax increases on high earners, corporations, and the financial sector by themselves could not cover much more than one-third of the cost of Medicare-for-all."" If Warren really believes Medicare-for-all will outweigh the downsides of massive tax increases, then she should be able to make that case.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-10-30	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders throws in the towel on explaining how to fund Medicare-for-all	txt-opeds/2310537660.xml.txt	Second, she can reduce the scope of Medicare-for-all by, say, not adding dental and vision care as Sanders's plan does, not covering illegal immigrants and not eliminating all co-pays or deductibles. That sort of plan will still cost a whole lot, but perhaps the funding options become more realistic when Medicare-for-all does not include free everything for everyone. (European health-care plans do not provide the gold-plated, extravagant benefits Sanders has adopted in Medicare-for-all.) That still might leave her with an enormous gap in funding. Third, she can put the transition to Medicare-for-all on a very, very, very slow path. In the past, Warren has suggested intermediate steps such as lowering the Medicare age to 55 or 50, allowing employers to buy in to Medicare or allowing employees to buy in to Medicare. These are reasonable steps that could vastly reduce the costs, but then Warren's plan would look an awful lot like plans from former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Some of her ""You're just not thinking big enough"" language could be thrown back in her face.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

For an ordinary candidate, that might be a feasible route, but for Warren, who is selling herself as a straight shooter, a departure from phony Washington politicians and a paragon of transparency, this might be the most damaging option of all. Her brand is essentially ""honest populism."" Whatever undercuts that and confirms opponents' accusations that she is slippery, shifty and inauthentic would run the risk of creating even bigger doubts about her candidacy. Finally, I would add that an honest accounting of Medicare-for-all should also include the impact on jobs. How many insurance company employees would be out of work?

He slashed corporate taxes, cut the top income tax rate and raised the total exemption for the estate tax, directly benefiting several hundred billionaires and their heirs. He’s placed wealthy supporters in key positions of government like the Commerce Department, rolled back Obama-era financial regulations and privileged the interests of favored industries — like resource extraction and fossil fuel production — above all else. There are billionaires who oppose Trump, of course. But for the most part they aren’t class traitors. They still want the government to work in their favor.

But when you say I should pay $100 billion, then I’m starting to do a little math about what I have left over.” He claimed that he was “just kidding,” but when asked if he would support Warren over Trump, he demurred.

As my colleague Patti Cohen notes, if Warren’s wealth tax had been in effect since 1982, Gates would have had $13.9 billion in 2018 instead of $97 billion, Bezos would have $48.8 billion instead of $160 billion, and Bloomberg would have had $12.3 billion instead of $51.8 billion. They would still be billionaires, but Warren’s tax would have taken a significant chunk out of their assets. And even if the wealth tax never became law, a Warren administration would still take a hard line on financial regulation, consumer protection and tax enforcement, key areas of interest for the super rich.

The final say still rests with voters, with ordinary Americans who retain the power to shape our government.

McAuliffe hasn't changed his delivery. He reiterated it in his keynote address at the University of Virginia's Center for Politics American Democracy Conference last week. Points for consistency, then. McAuliffe is trying to establish himself as the (potential) adult candidate in the race — neither too edgy nor too dull. The rest of the field isn't following his lead. If anything, the Democratic contenders (so far) are crowding the progressive lanes. For possible candidate McAuliffe, this is a good thing.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Not exactly a bad pitch to make for the Iowa caucuses. But as Walter Mondale can attest, it's not a winning idea in general elections. But even soaking the rich comes across as thin soup compared to Sen. Kamala D. Harris's (D-Calif.) platform. According to The Post's Colby Itkowitz, Harris very quickly established the litmus tests for the party's presidential candidates: Universal health care. A Green New Deal. An assault-weapons ban. These are the progressive issues that most Democrats running for president in 2020 will not only unapologetically endorse but also be expected to support if they have any chance of winning the Democratic primary.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

And the other contenders for the title of progressive litmus maker — including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — have yet to make their formal announcements. But there is one clear trend among Democratic presidential contenders: There's no such thing as promising too much — at least if one's entire presidential strategy is based on the twin pillars of resistance to the president and an aggressive progressive agenda. The midterms showed the resistance pillar can work if it's tuned to fit local sentiments. Resistance energized supporters of incumbent-toppling congressional candidates Abigail Spanberger and Elaine Luria. But neither candidate led with it on the campaign trail.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The upshot? According to the Brookings Institution: For every well-known Progressive upset — such as the victories of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York or Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts — there are victories of more conventional Democratic candidates. Democrats like Sen. Tom Carper (Del.) and Rep. Betty McCollum (Minn.) both easily defeated Progressive challengers.

His presence will be all Democrats need to win so why not make a big, bold, progressive statement at the same time? They had that opportunity in 2016. Democratic voters declined to take it. Which brings us back to McAuliffe. In remarks he gave at Tufts University back in October, McAuliffe said the nation needs a ""'very socially progressive, pro-business Democrat'"" in the White House. Not surprisingly, that's how McAuliffe described himself: a ""pro-business, fiscally conservative, socially progressive Democrat.""

Jerry Nadler's pithy pitch on Twitter: ""No one should ever be taxed twice on the same income. It's not fair and it's not just."" Deal! Quick, shake on it, before he realizes what he's saying. Conservatives have been making arguments about double taxation for years. We're glad to hear Mr. Nadler thinks the death tax and the corporate-income tax are unjust and should be repealed.

In reality Mr. Nadler is simply trying to reframe the unlimited SALT deduction, which is a tax break for wealthy urbanites mostly in New York and California, as a matter of justice. What makes his complaint especially unpersuasive is that it involves overlapping taxes by different bodies: The federal government has an income tax. So does New York state. So does New York City. This kind of thing happens all the time. Property taxes are assessed by cities, counties, school districts, fire districts and the like. The federal government taxes gasoline, as do states. When you buy a pack of gum, by Mr. Nadler's logic, the local sales tax should be deducted on the receipt before the state sales tax is calculated.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Say you own part of a corporation that makes $1. Setting aside deductions and whatnot, the federal corporate tax on that money is 21%, and Mr. Biden wants to make it 28%. When the profits hit your tax return, the feds take another cut, with a top rate of 23.8% on capital gains or qualified dividends. That's not all, as they say on TV. Imagine that instead of celebrating the remaining fruits of your work by taking the family on vacation, you prudently save and reinvest. If you die after managing to accumulate a sufficient sum, your reward is to have the feds swoop in again to assess the estate tax, with a rate of 40%. As if three mouthfuls of that original $1 weren't enough, Sen. Elizabeth Warren wants an annual wealth tax, with rates up to 6%.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE
2021-04-21	Wall Street Journal (Online)	Jerry Nadler's Double Taxation Lesson; He unwittingly calls to abolish the corporate and estate taxes.	txt-opeds/2515367261.xml.txt	Mr. Nadler's interest is something else entirely. Since 2018, the SALT deduction has been capped at $10,000. If the unlimited deduction were restored, according to a report last year from the left-leaning Brookings Institution, 96% of the benefits would go to taxpayers in the top quintile, with ""essentially no benefit to the middle class."" When the Tax Foundation crunched the 2016 data , the SALTiest place in America was Manhattan, which Mr. Nadler partially represents, with deductions of $25,627 per filer. Uncapping the SALT deduction would subsidize and induce higher state and local spending, since legislators and county councilors could impose a tax of $1 without inflicting $1 of pain on their residents. It's bad policy, and a sop to Mr. Nadler's constituents. If he'd really like to worry about double taxation, the corporate revenue code is the place to look.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

By definition, these returns don't contain information about unrealized stock-market, real estate and other asset gains that aren't ""income"" under U.S. tax law but ProPublica has decided should be. For almost the entirety of its purpose, ProPublica relies on Forbes's long-running research into the wealth of the richest Americans. Forbes did the work, tracking down and valuing the wealthy's assets for the years 2014 to 2018. More to the point, at any time in the past three years, anyone could have calculated how much the wealthy would have owed if unrealized gains were taxed. And did. Using the same Forbes data, economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, in a single sentence in a Washington Post op-ed in April, said everything ProPublica really had to say.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Whoever stole the tax returns was enterprising in another sense. ProPublica was enterprising only in inventing a piffling rationalization for publishing the stolen data and proclaiming itself the author of an important scoop. This rationalization comes down to a conceit: a taxpayer's actual payment in a given year, which ProPublica extracts from the stolen returns, compared against their Forbes unrealized gains reveals what ""we're going to call . . . their true tax rate."" This is a misuse of the word ""true."" So Jeff Bezos paid a tax rate of just 0.98% during years when he paid taxes of $973 million because the unrealized appreciation of his Amazon shares was $99 billion. Follow-up press reports all trumpeted this 0.98% ""true"" rate but it's a hypothetical rate based on a hypothetical change in the tax code. At least engage in the thought experiment honestly and recognize that such a tax would also affect the market value of his shares. ProPublica doesn't because the true tax rate is just a contrivance thrown in to give a role to the stolen documents.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

A more cogent reaction was that of economist and blogger Tyler Cowen: ""ProPublica acted unethically, and in fact nothing fundamentally new or interesting or surprising was learned from their act as accessory"" to data theft. Let's step back. When journalists are handed confidential information by a source, they aren't under any obligation to interpret the data or put the construction on it the source wants. In this case, ProPublica claims not to know who provided the tax returns; it could have been a foreign intelligence agency.

ProPublica is free to make its own judgment but marched predictably and exploitably to the tune of its source, whom ProPublica said claimed to support the outfit's ""previous coverage of issues surrounding the IRS and tax enforcement."" Realistically, was there a chance ProPublica would refuse the data? When it didn't, it had to find something in it to justify its meretricious scoop.

This is the real abuse—ProPublica describes itself as a ""nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power."" Let's end by noticing the relevance to a story that has exploded in the last few days about Trump-era investigations of leaks to journalists. While anonymity is supposed to protect sources notice that it also protects journalists. It protects them from the public finding out whom reporters are being manipulated by. It protects them from accountability for untruths they serve as conduits for. Reporters can always claim they accurately reported the words of sources who, of course, can't be asked if their words were accurately reported or if the relationship to the reporter was arm's-length and skeptical rather than conspiratorial.	4	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

The people who stole the tax documents might go to jail, but the journalists won't unless they conspired in or facilitated a criminal act.

It doesn't have to be this way. There is, in fact, vibrant, nuanced debate within the Democratic Party over policy approaches that could improve the lives of regular Americans. There are rival proposals for how to revamp our health-care system, including through Medicare expansion, Medicaid buy-in or single-payer.

I've written about the problematic (or perhaps convenient?) ambiguity of Medicare-for-all, which is in danger of becoming a purity test for 2020 candidates. For a time, the Green New Deal was also a popular slogan in search of a policy, inspired by the very real need for immediate, large-scale action on climate change. Last week, Rep.

In this desire to be all things to all people, it also makes huge promises unrelated to climate change.

The Green New Deal will ""absolutely"" pay for itself through greater economic growth, Ocasio-Cortez said, ""because we're creating jobs."" At other times, she and left-wing allies have suggested pay-fors are unnecessary because of a once-obscure idea called Modern Monetary Theory.

But even MMT doesn't make the pay-for problem disappear. While MMT is sometimes (mis)characterized as proving deficits don't matter if you can print your own money, that's not actually what MMT says. Ocasio-Cortez is a freshman representative, not a presidential candidate. She doesn't hold a senior Democratic leadership position. So who cares about her fuzzy math or other rollout blunders?

And now, seeing former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg's strong showing in Iowa and rise in polls of New Hampshire, Sanders is going directly after Buttigieg as a tool of the super-rich. Speaking in New Hampshire on Friday, Sanders read aloud a collection of recent headlines about Mayor Pete: One described how Buttigieg ""has most exclusive billionaire donors of any Democrat."" Another characterized the former mayor and management consultant as the party's ""big business candidate.""

Elizabeth Warren was criticizing Buttigieg for holding a fundraiser in a wine cave. Remember that? The basic facts are true enough. Sanders and Warren have eschewed big-money fundraisers not only out of conviction but because they can. Both of them, particularly Sanders, have had enough small donors to sustain their campaigns. Buttigieg, on the other hand, has gone the more traditional route of asking people who are capable of writing checks for a couple thousand dollars to do just that.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

So is it fair? The answer is a little complicated. It's certainly true that Sanders and Warren propose more sweeping policy changes, including a wealth tax, that billionaires are not going to like. But you could also argue that Buttigieg's economic proposals are still quite progressive. He wants a $15 minimum wage; greater protections for unions; expanded government spending on things like child care, health care, and family leave; and so on. In other words, Buttigieg, and some other candidates including former vice president Joe Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, are proposing a fairly standard Democratic agenda, which these days would entail significant change. But one of the key ways Warren and Sanders differ from Buttigieg in particular is that while they all see some of the same problems in the economy (like inequality), he tells a story without villains.

Nobody likes to be told that they're the problem, and the rich tend to be extremely thin-skinned. So if you're a Wall Street titan with liberal beliefs on social issues, Buttigieg is just your kind of guy — he won't make you feel bad, and all he'll ask from you is some slightly higher taxes and maybe a bit more vigorous enforcement of existing laws.

What we can certainly say is that there would be a personnel difference between Warren and Sanders on the one hand and Buttigieg on the other: Given their beliefs about the pernicious effect of Wall Street on the economic fortunes of ordinary Americans, Warren and Sanders wouldn't be staffing out the regulatory apparatus with alums of Goldman Sachs and J.P.

Instead of some back-and forth about who really loves billionaires (and I'm sure that by the time of the debate Buttigieg will have come up with a pithy one-liner to hit back at Sanders), what if we had them talk about the criteria they'd use in hiring regulators at the Treasury Department? And what specific new laws and regulations they'd like to see, if any, on Wall Street? Because, after all, that's what this is really about. If Sanders thinks it's a problem that Buttigieg raises money from billionaires, it's because he thinks that means Buttigieg won't be tough enough on them in tax and regulatory policy.

We seem to recall this—correct us if we're wrong—but then how are they going to explain their expansion of the state-and-local tax deduction for largely affluent taxpayers in mainly Democratic states? We realize that last point answers the question. This is a giant political payoff to House Democrats from New York, New Jersey, Illinois and California so they vote for the Sanders-Pelosi $4 trillion tax and spending bill. As a raw exercise in political and economic hypocrisy, this is one for the ages. Democrats didn't want to let this embarrassment rot in the sun for too long, so they kept SALT out of the House Ways and Means tax measure. Instead, they've now stuffed it into the reconciliation bill at the last minute, literally hours before a vote, with no press conference or fanfare, much less debate.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Register Now House Democrats are proposing to raise the annual SALT deduction cap to $72,500 through 2031. Republicans had limited the previously unlimited deduction to $10,000 in their 2017 tax reform on the sensible grounds that it was an unfair subsidy for bad fiscal policy in high-tax states.

The SALT expansion costs an estimated $291 billion through 2025, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model. But the GOP's $10,000 SALT deduction cap is set to expire in 2026. By extending their expansion through 2031, Democrats can pretend their plan saves money in the 10-year budget window. The scheme is a screaming advertisement for tax unfairness. In 2017 before the GOP imposed the $10,000 cap, New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, California, Massachusetts and Illinois were among the SALT deduction's biggest winners, with filers writing off an average of $17,295 from their federal tax bills.

Almost all benefits would go to taxpayers in the top 20% of the income scale. The Penn Wharton modelers estimate that only 9% of taxpayers in the bottom 80% of tax filers would get a tax cut.

The Tax Foundation's model gets similar results, with 87.6% of taxpayers earning more than $1 million getting a tax cut. Filers earning more than $250,000 would get 70% of all the tax savings from the Pelosi SALT scheme. This is simply an income redistribution ploy to buy the votes and campaign dollars of the affluent residents of big cities and suburbs.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Because lifting the cap saves money after 2025, a GOP Congress would have less money to extend these tax cuts.

2019-05-17	The Washington Post (Online)	Andrew Yang’s TED Talk version of politics	txt-opeds/2226658456.xml.txt	At a rally Democratic presidential contender Andrew Yang held earlier this week in New York City's Washington Square Park, I asked attendees how they found out about him. Many mentioned stand-up comedian Joe Rogan's popular podcast. A few also mentioned ""The Breakfast Club,"" the nationally syndicated morning show based out of New York. Exactly one person referenced the news — and, it turned out, he also told me his mother is a journalist. That's no surprise. Yang, 44, has acquired his small but devoted following outside conventional channels. Like Donald Trump (and Ross Perot before him), he's a businessman. Unlike Trump, he's not campaigning with a semi-improvised agenda targeted toward the resentful, the angry and the racist. Yang is a successful technology entrepreneur, ""a problem solver,"" as he likes to say. He's a man with a plan — a plan that consists of dozens of points encompassing everything from immigration reform to funding nonprofit journalism. He's for Medicare-for-all — and free marriage counseling and financial counseling for all, too. He's also against circumcision. He told the Daily Beast he'd like to educate the practice out of existence. He'd like to see an end to localities offering tax giveaways to entice businesses to locate within their jurisdiction, and a restoration of net neutrality. He says combating climate change needs to be a ""top priority"" of the federal government.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Yang argues that technology is going to eat up millions of jobs over the coming decade, wiping out everything from retail workers to truckers. ""How many of you have seen the self-service kiosk at McDonald's or another fast food restaurant?"" Yang asks. ""You kind of like them. I kind of like them too."" The only solution to this inevitability, Yang argues, is giving every American, beginning at age 18, $1,000 a month. He'd fund it by upping taxes on technology companies.	1	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-05-17	The Washington Post (Online)	Andrew Yang’s TED Talk version of politics	txt-opeds/2226658456.xml.txt	Yang has translated his unlikely background and platform into something of a cult following, centered around men under the age of 40. The idea that anyone except the occasional oddball would thrill to carrying signs with the word ""MATH"" emblazoned on them — which stands for Make America Think Harder — may feel like a stretch in the United States, where an anti-intellectual streak is writ large, and our current president is prone to saying such things as, ""I love the poorly educated."" But when people attending the rally talk about UBI, it feels more personal. ""It makes a lot of sense, because a lot of Americans are struggling,"" said Keegan Steinke, 24, a canvasser for a solar company. ""It provides a safety net for everyone, and it doesn't provide these perverse incentives like, 'Okay, I made this much, I might lose these benefits,' "" said Elliott Ribner, 32, a software engineer.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

One might even say support for UBI is not so much the typical American ""what's in it for me"" as much as aspirational. Millennials — who make up the bulk of this audience — have not exactly been the recipients of plenty. Yet Yang's critique is not an angry one. While he refers to Washington as a town of followers and not leaders, his take on American society is not particularly complicated. It doesn't wrestle with the systemic causes of our woes the way Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) do. Yang is not in favor of a wealth tax and instead argues for a value-added tax, which is a surcharge tacked onto consumption — something that hits low-income people harder than higher earners. He simultaneously wants to reduce the size of the federal government and to ""improve the recruitment and retention of younger workers,"" which is rather contradictory as a policy, not to mention vaguely insulting to long-term civil servants.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-05-17	The Washington Post (Online)	Andrew Yang’s TED Talk version of politics	txt-opeds/2226658456.xml.txt	Yang seems to believe many of our current problems are ultimately rooted in the deus ex machina that is technological progress wiping out jobs. But that's not strictly the case. This second gilded age was almost certainly accelerated by such advances, but that's by far not the only cause. Inequality was done to us by regulatory, legislative and judicial changes — one after the other after the other. Yang is not a politician. His plan appeals because it's politics made easy — by, well, removing the politics. Many attendees at his New York rally aren't all that political — it takes a minute for several to remember if they even voted in the 2016 primary. (Most say they did, and usually say they supported Sanders.) Yang's policy platform is rational, and an almost perfect fit for his audience, many of whom are tech oriented themselves. They cheer when he says he would use charts and a Power Point presentation as part of the State of the Union. That's when it occurs to me. Yang is a hipper, cooler update of modern American belief that a man of business can solve the messy world of Washington. It sounds smart, but he's ultimately still offering up simplistic solutions to difficult social and economic woes. It's a TED Talk version of politics.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The actual product is a tax bill sent mostly elsewhere, to the already highly taxed ""working rich."" The litany of the supposed tax crimes committed by tech founders and private-equity billionaires is long and well-known: ""They pay less than their secretaries do!"" They spend money borrowed against their shares, leaving most of their wealth untouched and untaxed until death. Their children inherit those shares, kicking in the step-up in basis, and their massive capital gains are then blasted into the loophole ether, leaving their heirs to pay ""only"" the 40% estate tax, some of which perhaps they can avoid. Private-equity billionaires do much of the same stuff and also get to use the famous carried-interest loophole. By trading their labor for shares in risky enterprises, the lucky—or very good—ones pay capital gains, not ordinary income, rates on these gains. And all these miscreants are, of course, supposedly hiding tons of untaxed wealth offshore, likely aiming to become Bond villains.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Under the actual proposal, capital-gains rates would go up, but the step-up rule to avoid them at death would remain. Carried-interest treatment is only slightly altered and current proposals seem to make this advantage even more exclusive to private equity and venture capital. The Internal Revenue Service would get more money for enforcement, but this would be directed, as usual, mostly against easier targets than the superrich. The IRS likely knows that there are few hidden hoards of American-owned offshore wealth. While few Americans were named in the so-called Pandora Papers, which revealed the shady offshore holdings of many prominent foreign politicians, they are nevertheless tacitly being used to justify raising taxes right here in the 50 states.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Ron Wyden wants not only to tax wealth but to do so annually on unrealized gains, which is truly insane. A wealth tax—as retroactive, unfair, and unworkable as it is—would at least actually hit the superwealthy, the pretend target of the proposed legislation. But as always, it would hit many others much harder who aren't so famous and powerful. So who will pay the bulk of the myriad tax increases? Call them the working rich—people with very high ordinary income in a given year. While some also qualify as superwealthy, many will earn high incomes only for a short while (think athletes and movie stars) and use those fat years to finance decades of lower earnings.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

These rates can exceed 50% today in blue states and cities (before adding Medicare taxes and all the rest). In our highly progressive tax system, the working rich already pay far higher marginal and average tax rates than their secretaries. They also don't have many ways to reduce their estate taxes. The working rich seldom resemble the caricatures used in the ""make them pay their fair share!"" sales pitch. Now, if you want to argue, as some do, that successful professional couples in New York and Los Angeles who already pay more than 50% in combined federal, state and local income tax should actually pay more than 60%, let's debate that honestly. After all, progressives pine for the days of 90% marginal rates from when ""Leave It to Beaver"" dominated the airwaves, even though that fairy tale has been repeatedly debunked as, unlike now, there were enough loopholes available to make the actual taxes paid far lower. Such a hike, phrased as above, would at least be honest. Though ""Make this hard-working, already high tax paying couple's taxes even higher!"" is a far weaker battle cry than demanding higher ordinary tax rates for alleged tax cheats like Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett who, unlike our well-off couple above, don't have much in the way of ordinary income to tax at the forthcoming higher rates.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Besides the sad and scary mass appeal of ""let's storm the castle"" bombast, another obvious guess is that the rhetorical targets have far more, and far better, lobbyists than those who'd actually pay these new taxes. Some of the superwealthy are clearly in on the game, loudly braying, ""Tax me more!"" Of course some are sincere and well-meaning. But many are only virtue signaling in the sadly rational expectation that their oxen won't be the ones that get gored. All of this lets the bill's proponents talk a good game while continuing to kowtow to some of their biggest donors. A more charitable—but still cynical—explanation is that those writing policy know that going after the easy-to-tax ordinary income of the working rich will be relatively easy and the working rich outnumber the superwealthy by a large margin, leading to far more revenue.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Crucial months were wasted trying to devise health reform legislation that could attract Republican support; Obama’s signature achievement happened only because Nancy Pelosi’s heroic efforts dragged the Affordable Care Act across the finish line. He was willing to make a “grand bargain” with Republicans that would have undermined Medicare and Social Security, deeply damaging the Democratic brand; he was saved only by the G.O.P.’s total intransigence, its unwillingness to contribute a single penny’s worth of tax increases.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Sanders, by contrast, doesn’t do bipartisanship. He doesn’t even do unipartisanship, refusing to call himself a Democrat even as he seeks the party’s nomination. But what Sanders appears to believe is that he can convince voters not just to support progressive policies, but to support sweeping policy changes that would try to fix things most people don’t consider broken. That, after all, is what his Medicare for All push, which would eliminate private insurance, amounts to. He is saying to the 180 million Americans who currently have private insurance, many of whom are satisfied with their coverage: “I’m going to take away the insurance you have and replace it with a government program.

Polling shows that support for Medicare for All falls off drastically when people are informed that it would eliminate private insurance and require higher taxes. You might try to rationalize the Sanders position by saying that Medicare for All is an aspirational plan, and that in practice he would be willing to accept a more gradualist approach. But that’s not what his behavior suggests. On the contrary, Sanders has conspicuously refused to support measures that would enhance Obamacare, even as a temporary expedient.

It takes courage to level with voters. Mr. Sanders's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination have done far better at that. Fresh off a big win in the Nevada caucuses, Mr. Sanders released on Monday his latest massive spending proposal, a plan to enable all Americans to get child care.

Each would rely on a mix of organizations — from small, home-based facilities to large day-care centers to public schools.

But Ms. Warren's and Mr. Buttigieg's plans would cost $700 billion over a decade, and Mr. Sanders's $1.5 trillion. What's the big difference? In large part, it is that Mr. Sanders would make government-sponsored child care free to all, even the wealthiest families. Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg would ask families that could afford to pay something to do so. The Warren plan, for example, would offer free services for those who make up to twice the poverty level — or about $50,000 for a family of four. Everyone else would pay something, their contribution determined on a sliding scale based on their income, though no family would have to pay more than 7 percent of its income.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Warren frequently cites the work of Messrs. Saez and Zucman and relies on their estimates to claim that her new wealth tax will raise close to $3 trillion over a decade. As for the Times detective, he suspects a particular response to the latest claim from the two economists. Writes Mr. Leonhardt: I already know what some critics will say about these arguments — that the rich will always figure out a way to avoid taxes. Sure, but what many critics across the philosophical spectrum are also saying is that Messrs. Saez and Zucman are simply wrong in their income and tax calculations.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

In fact, the OECD estimated that the U.S. has the most progressive household taxes among developed countries. Moreover, the 2017 tax reform is expected to have little effect on overall tax progressivity (Tax Policy Center, 2017; Joint Committee on Taxation, 2019). But Saez and Zucman (2019) argue that average tax rates are nearly equal over the income distribution. To examine this claim, this paper compares other estimates of average tax rates by income group, all of which suggest a high degree of progressivity. Three issues are found to bias the average tax rates presented in Saez and Zucman (2019). After correcting for these issues, their estimates align more closely with other estimates that show U.S. taxes are progressive.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Warren's favorite economists. Former Obama Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman took to Twitter this week to point out that U.S. high-income earners pay at a higher rate than low-income earners, both before and after accounting for state and local taxation. Economic historian Phil Magness an implicit rebuttal of the new Warren-friendly math in data from the Congressional Budget Office: The CBO's figures diverge sharply from the findings in the New York Times report. Whereas Saez and Zucman place the top 1 percent's total tax burden (federal, state, and local) at around 30 percent of its income in 2016 (the latest year available for comparison in both series), the CBO's estimate for federal taxes alone is actually higher at 33.3 percent.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

According to the CBO, the bottom quintile (20 percent) of earners paid just 1.7 percent of their income on federal taxes. Saez and Zucman's numbers also include state and local taxation, but their estimates for the poorest segment's overall tax burden leap to nearly 25 percent. While state and local tax burdens do skew somewhat in a regressive direction, other data suggest this spike is entirely implausible. Mr. Magness also cites work from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy that undermines the new claim from the Warrenistas. He also details some of the flaws, beginning with the calculation of income and taxes among those in the lowest income bracket: First, as Zucman recently admitted on Twitter, their series removes the refundable portion of the earned income tax credit (EITC) from the bottom quintile's federal tax burden. He claims this was done to separate the alleged ""muddle"" of transfer payments from the mix when looking at tax data, yet this produces highly misleading results.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

From the development of precision farming to the incubation of aircraft, space, semiconductors and computer systems, this state has emerged time and again at the cutting edge of future industries. That is, perhaps, until now. In a stunning procession in December, California lost the leadership of three iconic firms — Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Oracle and Tesla — all to Texas, which this year even took the Rose Bowl’s place in hosting the college football playoff. In addition, many California tech firms, including Uber and Lyft, as well as Apple, have been shifting jobs outside the state.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

In recent years, California has been losing market share of innovative industries compared with 11 states with high concentrations of innovation-oriented firms, according to research by Ken Murphy, a professor at UC Irvine’s business school. Since 2005, California’s share of the number of firms in the innovation sector (composed of 13 of the nation’s highest-tech, highest R&D advanced industries) has shrunk while competitors like Florida, Oregon, Arizona and Utah have expanded their share slightly.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

With 2 out of 3 tech workers willing to leave the Bay Area if they could work remotely, Big Tech could readily spread talent and wealth to other states. Increasingly, California’s cities must compete with metro areas in Texas, Tennessee and even parts of the Midwest. Housing prices are a particularly critical concern: California has all three of the most unaffordable metro regions for first-time home buyers, according to a recent AEI survey, and six of the top 10.

At the same time, states like Texas and Arizona have been sought to replicate the California formula for tech industry growth — public university expansion, more suburban housing and public investment in downtowns, all meant to appeal to workers and their bosses. California’s early emergence in both the aerospace and computer-related industries was strongly tied to physical proximity.

That formed the basis for Silicon Valley’s remarkable growth and created lots of well-paying jobs for a generation. But more recently, as the tech industry becomes more virtual and services-based, the companies’ workforces have less of a need to all be in one place. While these companies create vast wealth for a relatively small group of people, this is not a formula for broad-based economic prosperity. In contrast to the old Silicon Valley, the Bay Area has become “a region of segregated innovation,” as described by CityLab, where the upper class waxes, the middle class wanes, and the poor live in poverty that is unshakable.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The city of Long Beach has encouraged this growth by working with space industry executives to provide skilled workers through a partnership among industry, Cal State Long Beach and Long Beach City College. California’s economy has been buoyed by the tech industries for a long time, but that good fortune won’t last forever.

2019-03-31	The Washington Post (Online)	We should finally pass tax reform	txt-opeds/2200521820.xml.txt	Republicans promised to pass tax reform but instead delivered tax cuts heavily tilted to the rich and to corporations. Far from simplifying the code, this added complications, including the 20 percent rate for pass-through income. The result has been massive deficits, no sign of the economic boom President Trump promised and increased income inequality. In response, some Democrats are proposing a wealth tax, which is politically attractive but would raise less revenue than other proposals. Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers argue that ""base-broadening reforms — rolling back President Trump's tax plan, increasing tax compliance by the rich, closing shelters, eliminating stepped-up basis and deductions for the wealthy, and broadening the estate tax base — together raise more revenue than the wealth tax [from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] is estimated to."" They argue, as Republicans did once upon a time, that ""these measures would be desirable even if they did not raise revenue, because they would improve investment efficiency and correspond to the basic notion of fairness: If two people are similarly situated economically, one of them should not be able to pay substantially less tax because of cheating or taking advantage of quirks in the law."" The biggest argument against wealth taxes is that they don't work all that well: The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recently assessed wealth taxation and concluded that ""from both an efficiency and equity perspective, there are limited arguments for having a net wealth tax."" Of the three countries with a wealth tax, two — Norway and Spain — raise an average of 0.305 percent of GDP. These taxes generate less than one-third of what the wealth tax estimates despite having a much broader base: While precise data are hard to come by, we suspect that less than 10 percent of this revenue — or 0.03 percent of GDP — comes from those in the top 0.1 percent of the wealth distribution.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Former car czar Steven Rattner (as well as members of both parties over a decade or so) recommends narrowing the gap in rates between investment income (capital gains) and regular income (salaries): At present, a beneficiary of long-term capital gains or dividends pays 23.8 percent of the profit to Washington. That's already a good bit less than the 37 percent top rate on so-called ordinary income. Among the justifications for taxing profits on capital at a lower rate than income from work has historically been that companies pay taxes on their profits, so taxing shareholders on their gains represents a form of double taxation.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-03-31	The Washington Post (Online)	We should finally pass tax reform	txt-opeds/2200521820.xml.txt	But the 2017 tax cut legislation reduced the tax rate on corporate profits to 21 percent, from 35 percent. So if taxes on capital gains and dividends were raised by those 14 percentage points, we capitalists would be no worse off — and American companies would still be more competitive globally, the theory behind reducing the corporate tax rate. Even Republicans used to understand the benefits of leveling the rates between capital gains and ordinary income: It was a central feature of the 1986 tax reform bill, which best embodied the idea of lowering rates and broadening the base.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

(""Consideration should be given to limiting the deductibility of lobbying expenditures; restricting the ability of political organizations to have allied 50(c)(3) organizations that can receive tax-deductible contributions; and tightening the rules on donor-advised funds that enable the wealthy to get essentially all the benefits of foundations without any of the requirements to pay out resources or provide any public transparency."") More important, I would argue, is passing sweeping ethics reform, including some of the measures Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has recommended.

Last week, an alluring narrative coalesced around a band of Davids taking on the Goliaths of finance. Thousands of so-called retail traders who came together on Reddit have been using apps like Robinhood to buy stock and options of GameStop, the beleaguered video game retailer, jacking up its value some 1,700 percent last month. In the process, they’ve blown up a few hedge funds that had bet on GameStop’s failure. The appeal of such a narrative is obvious. Wall Street profits have blasted off during the pandemic, while Main Street endures intense and prolonged suffering, a phenomenon that economists call a “K-shaped” recovery. Americans have waited 10 months and counting for consistent relief from the government. So the idea of “get rich quick” schemes, especially ones animated by a zeal for revenge against the billionaire class, are more compelling than ever.

Rather than gambling on the dubious promise of more Americans gaining access to the casino, it’s time to rewrite the rules to ensure that the house doesn’t always win. Wall Street’s edge over retail traders remains, as always, structural: superior data; sophisticated, high-frequency trading software. More important, its traders have access to “dark pools,” private exchanges where they send large orders quietly to avoid moving the market against the trade, and “over the counter” markets, where they trade with one another rather than on public exchanges.

These retail traders betting on GameStop’s rise may have blown up hedge funds like Melvin Capital, which lost 53 percent of its value in January after betting that GameStop’s stock would fall. But other hedge funds are likely to profit off its troubles in the long run by scooping up a stake in Melvin Capital’s future revenues in exchange for an emergency cash infusion. One such hedge fund, Citadel LLC, further benefits from the actions of the Robinhood traders. Citadel’s market-making arm and other Wall Street institutions offer Robinhood money to execute its clients’ orders, an arrangement called “Payment for Order Flow.” (The idea was originated by Bernie Madoff in the 1980s. In 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission questioned whether it should be banned.) Citadel then profits by trading ahead of Robinhood users.

That’s because they are mostly agnostic to price movements, essentially making money on volume and market churn.

As further economic support remains in limbo largely because of Republican intransigence, the GameStop narrative may entice many to try their hand at the financial markets. Victor Yakovenko, a physicist at the University of Maryland, found a correlation between speculative bubbles and periods of greatest inequality. But those who tend to make the most during these bubbles are the already wealthy. Democratizing the economy, then, involves curbing speculation and pouring national resources into lifting up Americans and rebuilding public institutions. Canceling federal student debt, which President Biden can do without Congress, would grow the economy, relieve the disproportionate debt burdens carried by Black and brown borrowers, and incentivize science and engineering graduates to consider careers benefiting the public good. A modest wealth tax could be redirected to priorities like universal child care.

They're targeting the richest of the rich. Their boldest weapon is Sen. Elizabeth Warren's unprecedented wealth tax, dubbed the ""multimillionaire's tax."" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is only a step behind Ms. Warren with her proposal to hit the wealthy by nearly doubling the top income-tax rate, to 70% from 37%. Sen. Bernie Sanders, another self-described socialist, is eager to raise the estate tax's top rate to 77%. That's not all. Not only would health insurance be nationalized as Medicare for All, and everyone forced to give up private health insurance; a vast Green New Deal would propel America in a socialist direction. The Green New Deal has something for everyone on the left. It promises additional billions in welfare, a ban on fossil fuels, and the replacement of air travel with railroads. That's a partial list.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

Nor are Republicans anxious about polls that show how popular Democratic tax plans are. Those polls are normal. Americans have long felt the rich pay ""too little"" in taxes, according to Gallup. A survey earlier this month by Morning Consult found that 61% of Americans either ""strongly"" or ""somewhat"" favor Ms. Warren's plan, which calls for a 2% tax on the assets of those whose net worth is greater than $50 million and another 1% for billionaires.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But the GOP roadblocks may vanish in the 2020 election. Mr. Trump isn't a shoo-in for re-election, and Republicans, who control the Senate 53-47, will be defending 22 seats in 2020 while Democrats defend 12.

Elizabeth Warren's solution is a $700 billion federal program. On Tuesday, Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and presidential candidate, unveiled her Universal Child Care and Early Learning plan to turn high-quality child care into a federal entitlement. The federal government, working with states, localities and nonprofits, would subsidize a network of licensed child-care facilities that meet new federal standards for curricula and care. Families earning up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level would pay nothing for child care. Wealthier families would pay no more than 7 percent of their of annual incomes.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-04-28	The Washington Post (Online)	Good day care is hard to find. Elizabeth Warren’s plan might make it harder.	txt-opeds/2395438771.xml.txt	For many American families, however, the biggest challenge is not funding care but finding it. Warren's proposal wouldn't fix that problem. Instead, it might create a situation in which parents who already have child care they like wouldn't be able to keep it. Warren's plan would dramatically increase demand for an already-limited number of day-care slots, as out-of-home care suddenly becomes ""free"" or much less expensive for millions of families. The plan would also be available to parents who stay at home with their children, encouraging families to use day-care services they don't necessarily need. The result could be 12 million children, almost double the number currently enrolled, heading off to day care.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-04-28	The Washington Post (Online)	Good day care is hard to find. Elizabeth Warren’s plan might make it harder.	txt-opeds/2395438771.xml.txt	That's if their parents can find a place for them. Warren's plan does not address — and could exacerbate — one of the main reasons child care is so expensive and difficult to come by in the first place: the heavy regulatory burden imposed by states. Day-care licensing is generally managed at state and local levels, and the requirements can be notoriously onerous. Massachusetts is pursuing new background-check requirements so strict they could affect 30 percent of day-care workers in urban areas. A recently implemented District of Columbia rule requires day-care workers to have college degrees. Some regulation of the field makes sense — parents need to have confidence that their children will be safe — but initiatives such as the one in D.C. seem like regulation for regulation's sake.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-04-28	The Washington Post (Online)	Good day care is hard to find.

Karin Housley (R) blames on regulators who have made it difficult to comply with rules that govern things such as water temperature for hand-washing. In California, the number of licensed providers caring for children in private homes has declined by 30 percent over the last 10 years. The regulations affect not just supply, but also cost: A recent Mercatus Center study concluded that simply easing child-staff ratio regulations to allow one more infant per teacher would, on a nationwide basis, reduce average annual costs for a child's care by as much as $1,890 — without reducing the quality of care.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Elizabeth Warren’s plan might make it harder.	txt-opeds/2395438771.xml.txt	Warren's plan would likely aggravate these challenges. States licensing staffs already struggle to keep up with existing providers and regulations, and Warren's plan would increase both red tape and the number of centers requiring oversight — leading to delayed licensing approvals and causing inspection backlogs. Warren's plan would also create a vicious cycle that increases cost pressures on the families who can afford day care and puts ballooning financial burdens on the federal government. The federal government picks up most of the cost of the ""free"" and subsidized care. But the rest will come from fees that day-care providers charge to families who don't qualify for the subsidy, which will inevitably rise. Parents who earn too much for the subsidy will see their out-of-pocket costs grow — until those costs represent more than 7 percent of their income, at which point they, too, will be drawn into the subsidy pool.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But it ignores this sleeper tax on families worth much, much less. These pressures would be intensified by the Warren plan's requirement that day-care providers who want to participate in the federal subsidy program pay higher wages. Those providers will get federal support to meet the new pay requirements. But day-care providers who don't participate will suddenly have to pay workers more to compete for talent — and they won't be able to pass the bill on to the government. Many providers, particularly in-home or small-scale day-care facilities, may have to shut down. Ironically, many of those who could lose their small businesses are women.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-04-28	The Washington Post (Online)	Good day care is hard to find. Elizabeth Warren’s plan might make it harder.	txt-opeds/2395438771.xml.txt	These challenges ultimately point to a jarring mismatch between supply and demand for care. When the Warren campaign compares the structure and administration of the new universal child-care benefit to Head Start, it neglects to mention that, even though Head Start receives more than $9 billion in federal funding yearly, there are still significant shortages, epic waiting lists, and high unmet need. There isno question that day care is painfully expensive, and parents desperately want to know that, while they're at work, their children are well cared-for. But the United States' child-care challenges are not wholly — or even mostly — creations of the federal government. The introduction of an aggressive federal entitlement isn't the way to solve them.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Many of the same challenges they faced in June still confront them. Democrats still must make the case that the economy may be strong in the macro sense but that too many Americans struggle to make ends meet. As a group, they still must show that while impeachment is morally and constitutionally justified, they will not obsess over it to the exclusion of other issues voters care about most.

He's now plainly anxious for a rematch against Harris, who ate his lunch in June. The trick will be in puncturing her newfound aura of strength without appearing to be just another old, white guy bully.

Biden's initial rollout featuring Trump's Charlottesville remarks should remind us how effective he can be when he calls out Trump as a racist. Now, he must combine that with a full assault on Trump's patriotism and loyalty. Despite the Republicans' propaganda machine and the media's deliberate obtuseness, Robert S. Mueller III confirmed that Trump essentially betrayed America: His campaign invited foreign help, didn't report it when Russian-backed assistance arrived on his Trump Tower doorstep and then capitalized on it — all the while shedding doubt on whether he'd do it again.

But their most important dispute isn't about ideology or policy. It's about a more elusive quality: electability. Who is most likely to defeat President Trump in November? Many Democratic voters say that's their top priority not whether they agree with a candidate's positions. So far, the electability primary has a clear winner: former Vice President Joe Biden.

Republicans' perpetual insistence on cutting taxes for the rich and corporations starves the federal government of revenue, including for items that Republicans agree are essential (e.g., defense). Moreover, tax cuts have the effect of allowing those most capable of paying to pay less — or nothing — to support government. Politically and morally, this is unsustainable. As Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said to the New York Times in explaining the rationale behind proposed tax increases for the wealthy: ""What we're doing is generating revenue, but we are also making a major area of American government more fair, so people don't feel they've been played while the rich person gets off scot-free.""	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Dozens of others have reaped massive profits without making good on their promises to increase employment, wages and investment. Corporations are contributing a smaller share of federal revenue while collecting trillions in bailouts and deriving untold benefits of taxpayer-funded infrastructure, a public-educated workforce and protection from corporate and cyber crimes. Even more galling, corporations have learned to manipulate finances so as to substantially reduce their tax burden on overseas income. Likewise, ProPublica's jaw-dropping exposé illustrated the extent to which the wealthy have gotten wealthier while paying an effective tax rate far lower than the average American. The Times reports that Democrats see this moment as an opportunity: ""The ProPublica report added fodder. But even before the pandemic recession, corporate tax receipts had plunged 40 percent after the Trump tax cuts. Though the 2017 tax law ostensibly lowered the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, the effective business rate has fallen to 8 percent, said Representative Lloyd Doggett of Texas, a senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee.""	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Part of the promise of democracy is shared prosperity and shared contribution.

We are concerned that in many cases American markets are no longer the most competitive in the world. And, we worry that our country’s long-term economic strength will slowly deteriorate because of an unsustainable fiscal trajectory that leaves future generations worse off. The solution is not to upend the system. A market-based economy, for all its flaws, is still the best way to achieve broad economic prosperity and to ensure that living standards continue to rise over time.

Since founding the bipartisan Aspen Economic Strategy Group more than two years ago, our focus has been on bringing together leaders with different perspectives to highlight the importance of evidence-based policymaking. Earlier this week, 38 of our members signed on to a statement of principles that should guide the development of a new economic policy agenda.

This ensures that more American workers have the skills they need to compete in a global economy. Just as important, investing in education will increase economic productivity, which will help drive the wage growth needed to reduce income inequality. There are other steps we can take to further address the distribution of economic opportunity and wage growth. But as Melissa Kearney and Magne Mogstad have argued, universal basic income is not a viable solution. It directs resources away from the neediest individuals and fails to address the underlying factors that contribute to inequality.

Spending priorities such as education, infrastructure, and high-value research and development are underfunded, while our commitments to entitlements continue to rise indefinitely. Restoring the sanity of our fiscal position will require raising more revenue, slowing the rate of growth in health care spending, and making Social Security sustainably solvent. Returning to fiscal responsibility through spending reform alone is neither just nor possible. The United States needs to reform its tax code in a manner that is more progressive and produces more revenue. But there are better approaches than a wealth tax, which would be highly distortionary and is unlikely to capture nearly as much revenue as its proponents claim.

Patrick is not a universally known and beloved figure, nor someone like Mike Bloomberg with unlimited resources to force his way into the thick of the contest. Which raises the inevitable question: Why exactly is Patrick running? I'd like to look at that question in the context of one particular issue and how it shapes not only this race but also the entire future of the Democratic Party and the country: income inequality.

Patrick has spent his career moving between government and corporate positions, including some that are likely to raise uncomfortable questions among Democratic primary voters. After running the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department under President Bill Clinton, he joined the board of Ameriquest, one of the worst offenders among the subprime mortgage lenders who helped create the Great Recession.

You may remember that in 2012, Democrats absolutely savaged Romney over Bain's business model, which often involves buying companies, stripping them for parts and then selling off what's left at a profit. The attack was so brutally effective that ""Saturday Night Live"" mocked it with a skit. It just so happens that among Elizabeth Warren's economic proposals is one directly targeting private equity. It would impose a new set of requirements on firms like Bain, making it somewhat more difficult for them to still make large profits when the companies they buy go belly up. I can't say what effect her bill would have on the economy as a whole, but it tells a stark morality tale, about vulture capitalists who line their pockets while ruining the lives of middle-class Americans.

On Patrick's website, his still-vague ""Vision"" section talks about ""growing the economy out to working people and the marginalized, not just up to the well connected."" They all say they want to build an economy that works for everyone. But when Warren and Sanders talk about inequality, they tell a story with villains. Inequality didn't just happen, it's the result of certain people getting their way, people whose power must be curbed and whose wealth must be aggressively taxed. Warren has a new ad going after billionaires, one you can't imagine someone such as Patrick or even Joe Biden airing.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Biden, for instance, not only wants to raise the minimum wage but would strengthen unions and bar non-compete clauses that strip workers of power. But he also says, ""I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason why we're in trouble,"" adding that ""I get into a lot of trouble with my party when I say that wealthy Americans are just as patriotic as poor folks."" A pessimist (or a cynic) might say that ambitious proposals like a wealth tax will never get through Congress anyway, which means that in the end a President Warren will probably end up where a President Biden would begin, with some relatively modest tax increases on the wealthy used to fund more benefits and services aimed at lower- and middle-class people. That's an entirely plausible scenario.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

When Patrick says, as he did on Thursday, ""We've had a system where we have crowded and hoarded all of the benefits of our prosperity in a very, very few. This is what trickle-down economics looks like,"" it's hard not to respond, ""I'm glad you feel that way, but don't you work for Mitt Romney's private equity firm? Doesn't that make you the problem?"" The most passionate candidate isn't always the one who wins, of course. It's entirely possible that what the public is looking for is a nice fellow whose heart is basically in the right place and who can calm things down a bit. But at this point it's hard to see Deval Patrick's message — whatever it turns out to be — transforming the race.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

While trying to find rational explanations for stock market movements is often a mug’s game, in this case there seemed to be something specific driving the action: At that moment, you see, word leaked out that President Biden was contemplating a steep rise in the capital gains tax. As we’ve pointed out before, the capital gains tax is the quintessential rich person’s loophole. An increase would hit the 1% where they live — and the possible change reported by Bloomberg, which triggered the frenzy, would be earthshaking for that segment of American taxpayers.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The wealthy will fight him to the death	txt-opeds/2516435211.xml.txt	Those earning more than $1 million, according to Bloomberg, would pay a tax of up to 43.4% on their capital gains. The rate would comprise 39.6%, nearly doubling the current top rate of 20%, and the 3.8% net investment surtax imposed on taxpayers earning more than $250,000 (for joint filers) by the Affordable Care Act. That top rate would surpass the 37% marginal federal income tax on ordinary income paid by joint filers with income of more than $622,000. By effectively extinguishing the capital gains preference, Biden would be crossing the tax Rubicon. No wonder that stock investors expressed their dismay with what almost seems like panic selling.

Biden could announce a proposal on the capital gains tax next week, Bloomberg reported, with the goal of using the tax to fund part of his infrastructure program. For those subject to the tax, there’s a lot to love about it. For the rest of us, it’s a scourge. The capital gains tax chiefly benefits the rich, which imposes a commensurate burden on other taxpayers. It has become a tool allowing excessive wealth to be passed on to future generations, which exacerbates wealth inequality. It’s often defended as economically justified, but whether that’s true is debatable.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

That sticks in the craw of many working Americans, as it should. The full details of the plan being considered at the White House, as Bloomberg set it forth, are murky. Just raising the rate would open the door to more legal circumvention of the tax. Biden would have to impose a levy on unsold assets and change the rules for inheritances to fully capture revenues from the tax. It isn’t clear that White House thinking has gone that far.

According to the Federal Reserve, the top 10% of Americans by wealth owned 88.5% of all stocks and mutual funds. On the surface, the capital gains tax looks simple. You declare your gross income from the sale of stocks, bonds and other capital assets and subtract what you paid for them to get the net gain. That’s subject to a top rate of 20%, as long as you’ve held the asset for more than a year. (If not, then the gain is taxed at the higher rate of ordinary income.)	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

In 2021, couples with income below $80,800 and single filers with income below $40,400 pay no capital gains tax. Those with income between $80,800 and $501,600 pay only 15% on capital gains (the range for singles is $40,400 to $445,850). But that gives only a hint of why the wealthy love the capital gains tax. As it was described by the late Edward Kleinbard, who reigned for years as the resident tax expert at USC, the capital gains tax is our only truly “voluntary” tax.	5	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

That’s because no one has to pay it until they sell the asset. If they hold it until their death, their heirs pay nothing, thanks to the “step-up” in basis for inherited wealth. To illustrate, say your father bought a share of stock for $10 (his “cost basis”) that grew in value to $20. If he sold it while alive, he’d pay a tax on the $10 gain. If he kept it and willed it to you upon his death, its cost basis becomes $20 and you could sell it at that price without paying any tax. The capital gains tax just disappears.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-04-22	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Biden wants to hike the capital gains tax.

Nothing about this keeps stock owners from exploiting the embedded value of their holdings without selling. They can borrow against their stocks and bonds or sell options against them, for example. The capital gains differential is one tax break that isn’t capped, unlike deductions for mortgage interest or state and local taxes. The story of its value to the wealthy is told in the annual statistics published by the IRS. According to the latest edition, covering the 2019 tax year, taxpayers with $10 million or more in income reported an average of $15 million in income from capital gains. Middle-class taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 to $200,000 reported average capital gains of $10,750.	7	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-04-22	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Biden wants to hike the capital gains tax.

That’s because interest is deductible on mortgages only up to $750,000 (the limit was $1 million before the 2017 tax changes), whatever one’s income. Another important aspect of capital gains is that they become a larger component of income as one climbs the income ladder. On average, taxpayers reporting income of $10 million or more claimed about 57% of their income as capital gains or as stock dividends also subject to the low capital gains rate in 2019; only 16.9% of their income was reported as wages or salary.	8	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-04-22	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Biden wants to hike the capital gains tax.

These figures explain much of the politicking that has gone on over the capital gains tax and other taxes enjoyed mostly by the wealthy. Back in 2016, numerous affluent Americans came out in favor of abolishing the so-called carried interest tax loophole. This loophole allowed investment fund managers to treat much of the income they collected from their funds’ profitable investments as capital gains. The loophole was enjoying its moment in the sun as a tax controversy, which allowed advocates of its abolition to seem public-spirited. (“Close my tax loophole,” wrote one investment manager in a New York Times op-ed.) Even then-presidential candidate Donald Trump said he favored abolition.	9	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-04-22	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Biden wants to hike the capital gains tax. The wealthy will fight him to the death	txt-opeds/2516435211.xml.txt	But the carried interest loophole was only a political sop. “Carried interest is small potatoes compared with the value of the capital gains preference,” Kleinbard told me at the time. It was enjoyed only by a small subset of the top 1%, anyway, “so it makes sense to offer it up to quell popular dissatisfaction with how the tax system is operating.” The loophole never was abolished, anyway. Capital gains constitute such an immense portion of wealthy taxpayers’ earnings that they never seem to cease demanding that it be made even more generous. One perennial demand is to index the rate to inflation, on the argument that most capital gains are due to inflation and it’s unfair to charge stockholders for those gains. Anti-tax advocates have even taken a stab at labeling the capital gains tax the “inflation tax.” Among the promoters of this campaign was the Tax Foundation, which has been heavily supported by the Koch network.	10	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Whether Biden will follow through on what appears to be a strategically leaked policy draft and raise the capital gains tax is anybody’s bet. The proposal wouldn’t be complete unless it includes an end to the step-up in cost basis to heirs.

""The Secret IRS Files: Trove of Never-Before-Seen Records Reveal How the Wealthiest Avoid Income Tax"" is the headline on a story this week from ProPublica, which also avoids income tax. The story is highly disturbing because someone or perhaps multiple people broke the law in disclosing private tax-return data that ultimately ended up with ProPublica. This appears to be either a case of criminal hacking, an appalling abuse by Internal Revenue Service staff, or perhaps an abuse by foreign government actors who duped the IRS into oversharing.

2020-02-12	The Washington Post (Online)	Iowa and New Hampshire voters have bad taste in candidates	txt-opeds/2353350818.xml.txt	CONCORD, N.H. — Why do Democrats across the country tolerate the power voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, two idiosyncratic, overwhelmingly white states, exercise over the presidential nominating contest? The only coherent argument for their perpetual primacy has been that these small states contain demanding residents who vet major candidates face to face, giving them unique insight and wisdom. But their recent behavior suggests they are not all that great at that job, certainly no better than plenty of other states would be, considering the boost they have given to divisive extremists. In 2016, Iowa voters delivered a victory to Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.), who single-handedly shut down the government trying to defund Obamacare. New Hampshire voters then made Donald Trump's candidacy plausible, rather than a fringe expression of racial animus. On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist who advocates radical changes to the American economy, fought former secretary of state Hillary Clinton to a tie in Iowa and won New Hampshire. Now Sanders has repeated his feat from four years ago, battling to a virtual tie in Iowa with former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) and winning New Hampshire, albeit far more narrowly than last time.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-02-12	The Washington Post (Online)	Iowa and New Hampshire voters have bad taste in candidates	txt-opeds/2353350818.xml.txt	It's true that voter support for more traditional Democratic candidates in the race outstripped the support that Sanders attracted in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Even if you add the votes that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) got to Sanders's total, the left-progressive side of the party got only roughly 35 percent of the vote. But by handing Sanders two strong performances, Iowa and New Hampshire have lent momentum to him at precisely the moment when conscientious vetters should have put a stop to the Sanders fantasy. Think it's too harsh to characterize Sanders as an extremist? Granted, he is more like Cruz than Trump. Ideologically motivated, Sanders sells fiction, and not in the way all candidates sometimes overpromise. He pledges to drastically reshape the federal government, doubling its size, and uses cocktail-napkin math to claim to pay for it. Sanders's program would cost some $60 trillion to $97 trillion over 10 years — expert estimates vary but none of them bring this plan into the realm of the practical. His wealth tax, one of his major tools to finance this expansion, would raise far less than he estimates — between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion less over 10 years, according to a University of Pennsylvania analysis.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

In fact, Sanders does not have to spend nearly as much or impose nearly as many federal mandates to achieve the goals he — and virtually all Democrats — desire, such as generous universal health care, affordable college and an aggressive climate program. But he and his backers make it seem as though if you do not support his specific plans to achieve these goals, which call for maximum government control and social benefits that are lavish compared with those of peer nations such as Canada, then you do not care to achieve them at all.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Instead of listening to critics and adjusting his plans to better reflect expert analysis, or talking more forthrightly about their costs, Sanders has doubled down. And while Sanders's legislative program would never pass Congress, he would bring all of his ideological inflexibility and incuriosity to the hundreds of decisions he would have to make daily in the White House, and to staffing his administration. There are still many states, territories — and the oft-ignored District of Columbia — left to vote in this year's nominating cycle. But Iowa and New Hampshire got to go first. They got to set the tone for the race.

We still need money, so let's try a 15% corporate minimum tax—though be sure to exempt investments in green energy and other pet progressive ideas.

Tax policy should be about raising money to finance the government in the most efficient way possible while doing the least amount of economic harm. The Democrats' main goal these days seems to be to do explicit economic harm for its own sake. Take Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden's proposal for a wealth tax on billionaires. He finally released the details late Tuesday, and they're worse even than advertised. Currently assets are taxed only when they are sold and capital gains are realized. Democrats want to tax the unrealized gains of billionaires with more than $1 billion in assets or $100 million in income for three consecutive years, which the U.S. has never done.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Mr. Bezos, for example, would have to calculate his unrealized gains from the date of his initial investment to the present. He would then have five years to pay this initial wealth-tax bill, which in the Amazon founder's case could run into the tens of billions of dollars. This is after-the-fact wealth confiscation—merely because some politicians think Mr. Bezos has too much money. Yet Mr. Bezos made that money legally playing by the tax rules that politicians passed. Many if not most billionaires hold most of their wealth in unrealized gains. Paying that retroactive bill could require that Mr. Bezos sell his Amazon shares in a way that could affect the company's stock price.

But Mr. Wyden also won't let them go freely. Under current law, a U.S. citizen who renounces his citizenship is required to pay the unrealized gain on his property, as if it were sold on the date of renunciation. But payment of the tax can be deferred until the time the asset is sold, although interest on the taxes owed will accrue until the sale. As we read Mr. Wyden's proposal, he would end the deferral, so the former citizen would owe the tax immediately. This amounts to a forcible sale of assets so the government can confiscate a large part of it. It's a way of making it so painful to leave the U.S. that billionaires will have to stay.

2022-01-10	The Washington Post (Online)	The pandemic has exposed a persistent myth in Canada — and the world	txt-opeds/2618389644.xml.txt	The arrival of the omicron variant has upset pandemic endgame hopes, ushering in more uncertainty, frustration and suffering. Coupled with the end of 2021, it has also occasioned reflection on the past two years and contemplation of the years to come. As the world stares down Year 3 of the pandemic, it must also grapple with the persistent lie — widespread in Canada and around the world — that our suffering is collective and will therefore bind us to one another. Narratives of unity are convenient for politicians and for those for whom our social, political and economic institutions work best. Leaders in the business community, for instance, will call workers heroes. But to what end in the long term? Last week, the Canadian Center for Policy Alternatives released a report that found that ""the country's 100 highest-paid CEOs from the S&P/TSX Composite recorded their second best year ever for compensation in 2020."" That shakes out, according to the CCPA, to ""191 times more than the average worker wage in Canada.""

Some of them received modest, temporary pay increases. And then what? A September survey by LifeWorks — undertaken before the wave of omicron cases — projected ""an annual base salary increase average of 2.5 per cent in 2022,"" a jump from the previous projection of just under 2 percent. Accounting for inflation, however, it could amount to a pay cut as workers struggle to keep up with rising costs. In November, the consumer price index indicated a 4.7 percent rise year over year, consistent with recent trends. In December, the federal government temporarily expanded eligibility for one of its key aid programs, the Worker Lockdown Benefit, as provinces introduce new, extended or expanded pandemic protocols that disrupt work and social life.

The takeaway here is that state spending is immediately necessary to protect workers and address inequality. High-flung rhetoric about workers as heroes or ""being in this together"" is useless unless it is accompanied by measures that reduce inequality in the long term, build worker capacity to self-direct, and protect each and every worker in each and every industry. These necessities are nonnegotiable in a just society, both during and after the pandemic. Immediate and structural changes require resources. As David Macdonald, author of the CCPA report, argues, there are policies that can be adopted to pursue such changes. He suggests a basic principle for guidance: ""Those who did the best during the pandemic should be expected to pay more than those who did the worst."" He recommends a series of measures, including eliminating tax loopholes and preferential treatments and introducing a wealth tax. These are welcome ideas, but his guiding principle is key.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

The effects of covid-19 present a stark image of winners and losers, those who can afford to survive and those who can't, and the vulnerability of states.

At debates before then, some candidates went out of their way to describe what they’d accomplished or were proposing as “progressive,” especially if they were being maligned as (gulp) moderates. “Look, we all have big progressive plans,” Biden said, as if to reassure Democratic voters.

They have carved out positions to the left of the party’s nominees over the past two decades, including the most recent three: Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Kerry. And you know who gets the most credit for that? Sanders. The runner-up is Elizabeth Warren, who remains in the race spiritually if not physically, having also planted and cultivated ideas that spread far beyond her. Mike Bloomberg’s advocacy of a 5 percent surtax on incomes of over $5 million annually spoke to the pressure that her signature “wealth tax” put on Democrats to address how they would rein in huge fortunes.

Biden’s proposed tax increases of about $3.4 trillion over a decade are more than double what Clinton was advocating in 2016, while Buttigieg’s were more than quadruple. How is that moderate? The scare that Sanders put into Clinton four years ago and the organization that he built have transformed the party, moving it even further left than the questionable electoral successes of his movement justify.

An exemption for the first $2.5 million of household wealth would exclude the bottom 95 percent from paying any tax at all and leave the top 5 percent with total taxable wealth of roughly $40 trillion.

Both Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren proposed ongoing levees on wealth while they were running for president, applied every year, as part of a broad program of reducing economic inequality. Both proposals sought anti-oligarchy taxes, limited to extreme wealth of over $32 million (in Mr. Sanders’s plan) and $50 million (in Ms. Warren’s), which both candidates associated with the richest 0.1 percent. And both proposed to use the revenues that they raised to fund substantial expansions of the country’s permanent social safety net. The Sanders and Warren programs hold appeal, especially for progressives, but they also face challenges. The focus on extreme wealth reduces the tax base and therefore the revenue raised — while the top 5 percent hold two-thirds of the wealth, the top 0.1 percent hold roughly one-sixth. It also complicates collection. The very richest tend to store much of their wealth not in publicly traded securities but in private businesses, art and other difficult-to-value forms. The superrich also possess both the means and the motive to engage in offshoring and other sophisticated tax avoidance schemes. Finally, an ongoing wealth tax regime would affect future behavior, threatening to reduce capital accumulation, stifle innovation and depress growth.	6	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Indeed, in 1999 Donald Trump called for paying down the national debt through a one-time wealth tax of 14.25 percent on fortunes over $10 million. Today, an exceptional wealth tax’s ideological roots lie in a national solidarity that transcends ordinary politics. The effort to control the coronavirus is commonly analogized to a war, but while the entire society is indeed at risk, it is very hard for people without medical training to join the fight. A wealth tax would fund the relief effort in a way that gives meaning to shared sacrifice in the face of a universal threat. It is fitting that an extraordinary — once in a century — catastrophe befalling the whole nation should be paid for not from the income-flows that fund routine policy in ordinary times but rather by a one-time charge against the nation’s accumulated stock of wealth.	7	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

And being set off by a readily identifiable and truly exceptional event, the wealth tax would minimize both the motive and the means for evasion and impose no economic distortions on future savings or investment. As for the old canard that a wealth tax falls outside the powers granted the federal government by the 16th Amendment, the better argument holds that wealth taxes are clearly constitutional. And if the conservative justices of the Supreme Court want to reach into politics to exempt the rich from shared sacrifice in the face of a national catastrophe, Congress should dare them to try.	8	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

But the developing conversation about a wealth tax is at risk of being short-circuited by the unwarranted contention that such a tax would be unconstitutional. That is wrong. Whether the nation adopts a wealth tax ultimately should depend upon the policy choices of our democratically elected representatives, not faulty constitutional understandings. Current wealth-tax proposals take the form of a small-percentage annual tax on individuals' net worth over some large exempt sum. For example, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has proposed an annual tax of 2 percent on wealth in excess of $50 million, with a 6 percent tax on wealth in excess of $1 billion.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Farmers Loan and Trust Company. In that case, a sharply divided court reversed a century of precedent and practice to invalidate the nation's first peacetime income tax, with sweeping language that effectively denied Congress the authority to tax income or wealth. Pollock was part and parcel of the discredited Lochner Era. It also was one year before the stain of upholding Jim Crow segregation in Plessy v. Ferguson. The court thus took its wrong turn during one of its darkest periods. From 1895 to 1937,  the court invalidated numerous progressive economic policies — child labor and worker protections, minimum wages, maximum hours and more.

Consistently before Pollock, and almost always since, the court has upheld Congress's extensive authority to tax.

This requirement was part of the infamous constitutional compromise that counted enslaved persons as ""three-fifths"" of a person for purposes of legislative representation and direct taxes. As the Supreme Court has often noted, no clear understanding existed at that very different time about what taxes might be affected.

They interpreted ""direct"" taxes narrowly, as limited to those to which the apportionment requirement reasonably applies. Hylton unanimously upheld the constitutionality of an annual national tax on carriages, a tax akin to a national wealth tax in that it taxed a luxury property. To apportion the carriage tax by state population rather than according to carriage ownership would have been inequitable and nonsensical.

When I called up Chuck Collins on Tuesday afternoon, I found him glued to one of the grimmest new metrics documenting America’s economic and social unraveling. Collins is a scholar of inequality at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, and since March he has been tracking how the collective wealth of American billionaires has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic.

Instead, they’ve put on bejeweled overcoats and gloves made of spun gold — that is, they’ve gotten richer than ever before. On Tuesday, as the stock market soared to a record, Collins was watching the billionaires cross a depressing threshold: $1 trillion. That is the amount of new wealth American billionaires have amassed since March, at the start of the devastating lockdowns that state and local governments imposed to curb the pandemic. On March 18, according to a report Collins and his colleagues published last week, America’s 614 billionaires were worth a combined $2.95 trillion. When the markets closed on Tuesday, there were 650 billionaires and their combined wealth was now close to $4 trillion.

Billionaires amassed their new billions just as millions of other Americans plunged into dire financial straits. More than 20 million people lost their jobs at the start of the pandemic. As Congress lazily contemplates whether or not to bother to continue to provide economic assistance to America’s neediest, as many as 13 million people are at risk of losing the expanded benefits that keep them just beyond the grip of hunger and homelessness.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

If a federal moratorium on evictions is allowed to expire at the end of the year, millions of Americans will have to pay months of back rent — making them vulnerable to what housing advocates warn will be a wave of evictions.

Among these are the owners and investors of retail giants like Amazon, Walmart, Target, Dollar Tree and Dollar General, which have reported huge profits this year while many of their smaller competitors were clobbered as the coronavirus spread. Then there are companies that have bet on the rapid digitization of everything. Eric Yuan, the chief executive of Zoom, became a billionaire in 2019. Now he is worth almost $20 billion. Apoorva Mehta, the founder of the grocery-delivery company Instacart, was not a billionaire last year; this year, after a spike in orders that led to a new round of investment that pumped up the value of his company, he’s safely in the club.

Some of the numbers are staggering. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder, was worth about $113 billion at the start of the pandemic. Now he is worth $182 billion — an increase of about $69 billion. Jim, Alice and Rob Walton, three of the largest shareholders of Walmart, saw their combined wealth grow by $47 billion during the pandemic. Two years ago, Bezos was the only “centibillionaire” on earth — the trendy neologism for people whose wealth exceeds $100 billion. Now there are five — in addition to Bezos, there’s Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Bernard Arnault, the French luxury tycoon.

A year ago, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren appeared to have a good shot at capturing the Democratic nomination for president, and pundits like myself were suggesting extreme measures like the abolishment of billionaires. Billionaires can breathe much easier now. Joe Biden, not Sanders or Warren, is going to be the president.

Some of the most ambitious liberal efforts to combat inequality — like a repeal of Trump’s corporate tax cuts, a new wealth tax or a tax on financial transactions — look unlikely to pass. The political results point to the continuing danger to our democracy of the rise of superbillionaires — that they will use their wealth to build a political fortress around themselves, allowing them to gain even more wealth and influence. “I do think we’re at risk of the oligarchic death spiral,” Collins told me. “Wealth concentrates and power concentrates, and the wealthy use their power to rig the rules to get more wealth and power.”	7	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Perhaps, seeing the pandemic’s toll on nonbillionaire Americans, our leaders will be moved to fight for greater benefits for workers, more affordable and accessible health care and child care, and progressive taxation that can reduce some of the disparities between people at the top and everyone else.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) instead of, for example, vendors who also work for corporate polluters or union busters.

The arrangement benefited Cuomo, as he could move forward legislation he favored while sidelining anything that threatened his real estate and Wall Street donors. In the 2018 primaries, the WFP and its allies defeated six corporate-backed Democrats in the state Senate, nominating insurgents who ran pledging not to take a penny from the real estate industry.

His plan was the creation of a commission to design a system of public financing of elections that also empowered to make unilateral changes to minor party ballot access laws.

In previous debates, Ms. Warren avoided saying exactly how she would pay for the tens of trillions in new government spending the health care system she favors would entail. But she recently released both a financing plan and an implementation timeline in which she proposed putting off the push for a full-fledged single-payer system. That segment opened with Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., touting his own plan, which he calls Medicare for All Who Want It, as a way to avoid the “divisive” step of eliminating most private insurance and forcing most Americans onto a government health care plan. Mr. Biden, similarly, framed his opposition to Ms. Warren’s proposal by saying, “I trust the American people.” Once again, it was an attack not only on Ms. Warren’s plan, but on the political philosophy it represents.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Now is the time, he said, practically pounding the podium. “In the first week of my administration, we will introduce Medicare for All.” The message was clear: Warrenism, which would wait until year three to fight for single-payer, was insufficiently devoted to the revolutionary cause.

Senator Elizabeth Warren unveiled a new wealth tax proposal last week that she says will raise — along with her previously announced wealth tax plan — $3.75 trillion over the next decade. Senator Bernie Sanders says his wealth tax will yield $4.35 trillion over the same period. We fear these figures are vast overestimates. The likeliest outcome is that a wealth tax will raise exactly zero dollars. The problem, alas, is the Constitution. The Warren and Sanders plans run headlong into more than two centuries of precedent that cast doubt on the constitutionality of wealth taxation.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

We are heartened that prominent Democratic presidential candidates are taking the problem of wealth inequality very seriously. We are worried, though, that leading figures in our party are coalescing around an idea whose constitutionality is doubtful at best. The constitutional objection to wealth taxation is based on two clauses that require any “direct tax” to be apportioned among the states based on population. So, since 12 percent of the population lives in California, Californians must pay 12 percent of any direct tax.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-11-07	New York Times (Online)	The Big Problem With Wealth Taxes	txt-opeds/2312476495.xml.txt	For the Warren and Sanders wealth taxes, that would be a deal breaker. To match revenue fractions to population percentages, as the Constitution’s direct tax clauses demand, we estimate that the wealth tax rate in West Virginia — the poorest state per capita — would need to be roughly 10 times the rate in more affluent California and more than 20 times the rate in prosperous Connecticut. The Warren and Sanders wealth taxes would very likely be classified by courts as “direct taxes.” Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist No. 36 that taxes on “houses and lands” were direct taxes. Supreme Court majorities have said on at least seven occasions that federal taxes on real property (land and buildings) are “direct taxes.” Congress enacted at least five federal property taxes in the 18th and 19th centuries and apportioned them based on state population each time.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-11-07	New York Times (Online)	The Big Problem With Wealth Taxes	txt-opeds/2312476495.xml.txt	The proposed wealth taxes would apply to  real property, which would seem to make them “direct taxes.” Both plans would also tax personal property, which encompasses all assets other than land and buildings, like securities and art. Some wealth tax defenders argue that even if a tax on real property is “direct,” a tax on real plus personal property is not. The idea is that — by some feat of constitutional alchemy — combining the concededly unconstitutional tax on real property with the purportedly less problematic tax on personal property erases the flaw with the former. Hamilton would not have agreed. In 1794, Congress passed a $16 tax on carriages, which was challenged in Hylton v. United States. Hamilton argued at the Supreme Court that the carriage tax was not a direct tax, and so did not require apportionment — and the court agreed. But in a legal brief he wrote in the case, he acknowledged that “general assessments … on the whole property of individuals” — in other words, wealth taxes — are direct taxes requiring apportionment. Hamilton’s concession is especially significant because of all the founders, he had perhaps the broadest view of Congress’s taxing power.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-11-07	New York Times (Online)	The Big Problem With Wealth Taxes	txt-opeds/2312476495.xml.txt	And again, it’s not just Hamilton who thought this. The future Chief Justice John Marshall, at the Virginia ratifying convention, said that direct taxes included not only taxes on land but at least some personal property taxes too. On at least three subsequent occasions, Supreme Court majorities have said that taxes on real and personal property are direct taxes. Chief Justice John Roberts echoed these precedents in his opinion upholding the Affordable Care Act in 2012. A second argument made by wealth tax supporters is that the only direct taxes are taxes that can be apportioned among the states without too much hassle. They attribute this view to solo opinions by two justices in the Hylton case, Samuel Chase and James Iredell. But another member of the Hylton court, William Paterson, suggested that wealth taxes might be direct taxes too. And majorities of the court have since rejected the notion that the only direct taxes are those that can be apportioned easily. It would, in any event, be a peculiar sort of constitutional rule that applied only in cases where it had no bite.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-11-07	New York Times (Online)	The Big Problem With Wealth Taxes	txt-opeds/2312476495.xml.txt	Finally, wealth tax defenders point to the 16th Amendment, which authorizes Congress to tax “incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment.” The framers of the 16th Amendment thought about scrapping the direct tax clauses entirely, but they decided instead to limit the amendment to “incomes.” An income tax is a tax on wages and money received from property, while a wealth tax is a tax on the value of property itself. The amendment applies to taxes on income, not to taxes on wealth. Wealth tax proponents might argue that progressives ought not trim their sails simply because they fear that hostile justices will strike down their policies. Certainly, it would have been bad advice to tell President Franklin Roosevelt not to pursue the New Deal because a conservative court would fight back. But this is not an instance of ideologically motivated jurists pulling a rabbit out of a hat. A good-faith reading of history and precedent would suggest that the Warren and Sanders wealth taxes are unconstitutional.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-11-07	New York Times (Online)	The Big Problem With Wealth Taxes	txt-opeds/2312476495.xml.txt	Several wealth tax advocates have argued that constitutional concerns can be addressed by enacting a “fallback” provision that would put in place other taxes on the rich if a wealth tax is struck down. Pushing one major tax change through Congress will be hard enough; passing two plans — a wealth tax plus a fallback — will be a herculean challenge. Legislators, moreover, have an independent obligation not to enact unconstitutional laws. Members of Congress would be abdicating that duty if they enacted a wealth tax they thought was constitutionally flawed. Fortunately, there is much that Congress — in cooperation with a progressive president — could do to combat wealth inequality without running afoul of constitutional limitations. By closing loopholes and hiking rates on top earners, Congress could reduce inequality and raise trillions of dollars without a constitutional hiccup.	6	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

It will raise no money to pay for universal health care and child care, greater investments in education or ambitious efforts to halt global warming. It will, instead, mire the country and the courts in yearslong litigation. And it will most likely lead to a Supreme Court ruling that sends us back to square one in our fight to fix a tax system that all too often favors the rich.

The news came just days after Oxfam International reported that 26 billionaires have the same combined net worth as the poorest 3.8 billion people on the planet. Meanwhile, many of America's richest corporate executives spent the week hobnobbing in Davos, Switzerland, where they focused on the preposterous idea of ""upskilling"" as a potential answer to rising economic inequality. It seems every day brings a fresh reminder of how the economy is rigged in favor of an out-of-touch financial elite gobbling up more and more of America's wealth. Yet until recently, our political leaders have, with few exceptions, failed to respond with the kind of bold policies required to make a dent in the problem. Sen.

The plan was formulated with the help of University of California at Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two of the world's leading experts on income and wealth inequality, who estimate that it would raise $2.75 trillion over a decade. Specifically, Warren is calling for a tax of 2 percent on the assets of those with a net worth above $50 million and 3 percent on billionaires.

Indeed, Warren's proposal is a potential game changer. Her status as top 2020 presidential contender is forcing many in the media to pay attention to a problem they often ignore. Much like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's (D-N.Y.) suggestion that top earners should pay marginal tax rates as high as 70 percent, Warren's plan has already won support from voices typically aligned with the Democratic establishment. ""The incidence of extreme wealth inequality — as well as the magnitude of never-taxed wealth — is just so obscene at this point in our nation that I think there is simply no choice but to explore a wealth tax like this,"" said Gene Sperling, who served as a top economic adviser in both the Obama and Clinton administrations.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

(On Fox News, it was preposterously likened to Venezuelan socialism.) Others have argued that it would be unconstitutional, a dubious claim that relies on a controversial 1895 Supreme Court ruling that, as the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy explains, ""has been limited to the point of irrelevance by subsequent opinions."" But the swift blowback from Warren's critics is not surprising given that a wealth tax is all but certain to be extremely popular. For years, polls have consistently shown that Americans favor raising taxes on the wealthy. A survey this month found that, despite attempts to portray Ocasio-Cortez's idea as radical, nearly 60 percent of Americans support much higher marginal tax rates. Moreover, while inequality has become so extreme that it can sometimes feel paralyzing, a wealth tax is a simple and bold idea that people can mobilize behind.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

California's tax is also more punitive than the one proposed earlier this month by Vermont senator and avowed socialist Bernie Sanders. That bill would impose a 60 percent tax on net-wealth profits from March 18 through the end of 2020 — but only on billionaires. In California, though, sticking it to ""the rich"" is a state pastime. Two ballot measures passed in 2012 and 2016 raised taxes on incomes starting at $250,000 — not exactly aimed at plutocrats in a state where, in some places, household incomes around $240,000 are still considered ""middle class.""

For one, because it's an idea that's already been shown to fail. More than a dozen European countries already went down this road and found that a combination of clever asset management, flight abroad and intense lobbying for exemptions meant the levies didn't generate the hoped-for revenue. As a result, nearly all of these countries eventually ditched their wealth taxes. Second: One problem with national wealth taxes is the ease with which people can park their assets abroad. The Golden State, however, would be picking fights not only with other countries but also with other U.S. states. The proposed wealth tax would impose levies on citizens for up to a decade after those Californians fled to lower-tax pastures. This would not be a case of governments working across state lines, as one might expect in a manhunt. States such as Nevada, Arizona and Texas take great pleasure in poaching California's moneyed elite with promises of lower taxes and less bureaucracy. Don't expect revenuers in Austin or Carson City to do any favors for their counterparts in Sacramento.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Cash is easy to value, but what about farmland or jewelry inherited from grandma? Inevitably, the state and taxpayers are going to arrive at different estimates, and the only guaranteed winners in this scheme will be art appraisers willing to low-ball multimillionares' Monets. With deep pockets and a lot of money on the line, wealthy Californians could lawyer up and keep the state perpetually tied up in tax litigation — both delaying and lowering anticipated revenues. With all of these warnings, is the tax likely to be enacted? Democrats enjoy supermajority control of California's two legislative chambers, so the requisite two-thirds approval is easily doable. Given the state's massive budget deficit, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) may be looking at an offer he can't refuse — not when there's a rosily estimated multibillion-dollar windfall involved, and not when the tax targets some 30,400 people in a state 1,300 times that large.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

If that happens, California millionaires would be looking at a total top income tax rate of nearly 54 percent for federal and state taxes. But California lawmakers may be tempting fate. The state's revenue system already is overly dependent on millionaires and billionaires: The top 1 percent of taxpayers generate half of personal income tax receipts.

Which is why most countries have decided to avoid the bother. Consumption taxes such as sales or value-added taxes are easy to administer and raise lots of revenue. Income taxes are trickier but still simple compared with taxing wealth. Most people regularly receive payments that are easy to track and can be valued at . . . the sum of the payments.

That's one reason wealth taxes, once popular among Western nations, are trending toward extinction; the paltry revenue wasn't worth the administrative headache. Nor the capital flight and slower rate of capital formation such taxes tend to induce. Those problems would be particularly acute with Warren's plan because she has targeted the very wealthy rather than the merely affluent. Doing so mitigates the inevitable wailing about family-owned farms, as well as some of the pressure to lard the tax with those revenue-depleting exemptions. But taxing only the super-rich means taxing people with a lot of unique, hard-to-value assets, and who can confound auditors by shifting their wealth into even more of those assets.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

Warren's team, and many other progressives, have offered ingenious arguments for the plan's constitutionality. Probably not clever enough, however, to sway a conservative-leaning Supreme Court.

Looking at the 25 richest Americans, whose collective worth rose by $401 billion between 2014 and 2018, the report found: Many of the super-rich pay no taxes or virtually no taxes. Buffett, who popularized the tax reform argument that he pays a lower rate than his secretary, was not exaggerating. To the contrary, he paid ""a true tax rate of 0.1%, or less than 10 cents for every $100 he added to his wealth."" Even more striking, the billionaires were getting richer — a lot richer — while Americans suffered from two economic recessions and a pandemic.

President Biden has proposed tinkering around the edges, raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent (only part of the way back to 35 percent, where it had stood until 2017) and raising taxes for those making more than $400,000 to 39.6 percent while eliminating the differential between ordinary income and capital gains.

Andrew Yang may be running with a campaign button reading ""Math,"" but it's Warren who has successfully framed herself as the wonk on the debate stage. Yet as she has inched toward the front of the pack, her fellow candidates have pointed out, with increasing ferocity, that Warren's Medicare-for-all promises use a big hand-wave where the numbers ought to be.

The good news is, the math adds up, as long as you buy her assumptions. The bad news is that Warren's assumptions are crazier than keeping a pet rhinoceros, after which, who cares that her calculator works? This is to actual policymaking as the plastic noodles in a ramen-bar window is to lunch. To wit: Warren says she can deliver a generous Medicare-for-all plan with only $20.5 trillion in additional federal spending. That's a quarter to a third less than any serious estimate of the plan from outside her campaign. How will she get there? Why, by slashing administrative costs and then mandating that everything else cost less. Warren is not exactly the first progressive reformer to have this same idea, and if she pushes forward with it, she will be but the next in a long line to discover that she can't make it work, politically or economically. As Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner dryly noted, Warren could just as well have written that Mexico was going to pay for her big, beautiful plan.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Take her proposed wealth taxes — no, not the 3 percent ultra-millionaire wealth tax she has already pledged for other things, but an entirely new 3 percent tax on all wealth over $1 billion. The tax would, Warren says, raise $1 trillion over 10 years. The assumption is typical of her whole plan. Because on one level the math does work: The United States has about 600 billionaires, and by my calculation, the total value of their wealth-taxable assets would be something under $3 trillion. Three percent of that, collected 10 times, should indeed yield nearly $1 trillion.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

After adding in the ultra-millionaire's tax and factoring in the other capital taxes Warren wants to levy — on financial transactions, on unrealized capital gains, on corporations — we'd be asking every billionaire to hand over more than two-thirds of their total wealth over a 10-year period. If the government actually managed to collect it, their fortunes would rapidly erode — and so would tax collections.

If Warren makes it to the White House, and tries to pass a plan, the Congressional Budget Office will eventually attach more reasonable numbers, with more defensible assumptions, sparking an even more spectacular political blowback than the one that greeted Friday's announcement. Outside of the progressive Twitterati, there isn't necessarily an enormous constituency for spending $20.5 trillion to herd every American into a national health insurance program; there would be even less support for spending what Warren's plan would actually cost. And even if she somehow pushed her program through, there's a good chance that courts would strike it down, because so many of the revenue-raisers may be unconstitutional. Between the problems with her wealth taxes (Article I, Section 9), her plan to divert employer premiums to the government (ex post facto taxation of health benefits) and her requirement that state and local governments toss $3 trillion into the kitty (anti-commandeering doctrine), Warren would be a couple of adverse court decisions away from a $15 trillion hole in her $20 trillion plan.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

If “moderation” or “centrism” means holding broadly popular positions otherwise marginalized by extremists in either party, then these prospective candidates don’t quite fit the bill. Senator Elizabeth Warren’s proposed wealth tax on the nation’s largest fortunes is very popular , according to recent polling by Morning Consult, with huge support from Democrats and considerable backing from Republicans. But Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York who has flirted with running for president as a moderate Democrat, rejects the plan as an extreme policy that would put the United States on the path to economic ruin. “If you want to look at a system that’s noncapitalistic, just take a look at what was once, perhaps, the wealthiest country in the world, and today people are starving to death. It’s called Venezuela,” he said during a January trip to New Hampshire.

A substantial majority of the public favors proposals to greatly expand college access or make it free outright. In a January op-ed for The Washington Post, McAuliffe dismissed “universal free college” as a misuse of tax dollars. “Spending limited taxpayer money on a free college education for the children of rich parents badly misses the mark for most families.” And let’s not forget Howard Schultz, the former Starbucks chief executive who might run for president as an independent, who characterizes himself as a “centrist” despite holding positions that have little traction among the public as a whole. “We have to go after entitlements,” he has said , referring to the unpopular idea of cutting Social Security and Medicare to shrink the federal deficit.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

You’ll find the answer in two comments from Joe Biden, who served two terms as vice president under President Barack Obama and is mulling a third run for the Democratic nomination. The first is from a speech in 2018, the second from more recent remarks to the United States Conference of Mayors. Speaking last May at the Brookings Institution, Biden rejected the confrontational language of some other Democrats. “I love Bernie, but I’m not Bernie Sanders,” he said . “I don’t think 500 billionaires are the reason we’re in trouble.

Republicans used these comments to bolster Upton in campaign advertising, helping him win a narrow victory over his Democratic challenger. Biden’s response to critics was defiant. “I read in The New York Times today that I — that one of my problems is if I ever run for president, I like Republicans,” he said. “O.K., well, bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” Biden hasn’t endorsed a “Medicare for all” plan, but if he runs, he won’t be running on deficit reduction or modest tweaks to existing programs. He supports free college and a $15-per-hour minimum wage. He wants to triple the earned-income tax credit, give workers more leverage and raise taxes on the rich. This is a liberal agenda .

For Biden, you don’t need to demonize the richest Americans or their Republican supporters to reduce income inequality; you can find a mutually beneficial solution. Bloomberg, a billionaire, may have a personal reason for rejecting wealth taxes, but he may also see them as unnecessary and antagonistic if the goal is winning powerful interests over to your side.

The first, of course, is the explosion of income among top earners, in which a tiny minority has vacuumed up a ballooning share of the gains from the past few decades of economic growth.

A new analysis prepared at my request by Gabriel Zucman — the French economist and ""wealth detective"" who has become famous for tracing the hidden wealth of the super-rich — illustrates that dual story in a freshly compelling way. The top-line finding: Among the bottom 50 percent of earners, average real annual income even after taxes and transfers has edged up a meager $8,000 since 1970, rising from just over $19,000 to just over $27,000 in 2018.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-12-09	The Washington Post (Online)	The massive triumph of the rich, illustrated by stunning new data	txt-opeds/2322985414.xml.txt	By contrast, among the top 1 percent of earners, average income even after taxes and transfers has tripled since 1970, rising by more than $800,000, from just over $300,000 to over $1 million in 2018. Among the top 0.1 percent, average after-tax-and-transfer income has increased fivefold, from just over $1 million in 1970 to over $5 million in 2018. And among the top .01 percent, it has increased nearly sevenfold, from just over $3.5 million to over $24 million. I'm emphasizing the phrase ""after taxes and transfers"" because this is at the core of Zucman's new analysis. The idea is to show the combined impact of both the explosion of pretax income at the top and the decline in the effective tax rate paid by those same earners — in one result.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-12-09	The Washington Post (Online)	The massive triumph of the rich, illustrated by stunning new data	txt-opeds/2322985414.xml.txt	The declining progressivity of the tax code is the subject of ""The Triumph of Injustice,"" a great new book by Zucman and fellow Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez. It charts the slow strangulation of that progressivity at the top. As they demonstrate, the effective tax rate (federal, state, local and other taxes) paid by top earners has steadily declined since the 1950s and 1960s, when the tax code really was quite progressive, to a point where the highest income groups pay barely more, percentage wise, than the bottom. Indeed, in 2018, the top 400 earners for the first time paid a lower effective overall tax rate than working-class Americans. There are many reasons for this radical decline in progressivity, including domestic and international tax avoidance, the whittling away of the estate and corporate taxes, and the repeated downsizing of top marginal rates.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

This includes federal, state and payroll taxes of numerous kinds, and government spending on transfer programs, including Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and disability and veteran benefits, among other things. Zucman is able to do this because he and Saez created a database to do the new book's calculations, and this database includes as much income, tax and transfer information at all levels of government as they were able to assemble. Here are Zucman's results: As noted, real after-tax-and-transfer income edged up just a bit among the bottom 50 percent while rocketing upward to an extraordinary degree among the top-earning groups.	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

""After government transfers, the income of the working and middle class has grown a bit faster than before, but still their income growth rate has been very low,"" Zucman told me. ""For the working class, their after-taxes-and-transfers income has barely increased."" And among those in the group from the top 10 percent to 1 percent, average income went from just over $90,000 in 1970 to over $185,000 in 2018.

Even Joe Biden's plan, which would raise corporate tax rates and return top marginal income tax rates to where they were before President Trump's tax cuts, is surprisingly progressive, a sign of how much this debate has shifted. Meanwhile, Warren has proposed a tax on extreme wealth. And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has offered an even more ambitious wealth tax, plus a proposal to boost top income tax rates far more than any other rival. The larger context for this debate is that real-world take-home income has positively exploded at the very top, even as it has barely budged for the bottom half — the sum total of two separate but intertwined stories that have unfolded over the decades.	8	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

""We are in the battle for the soul of this nation,"" he said Thursday in a web video , which centered on the 2017 Charlottesville, Va., rally by white nationalists. ""I believe history will look back on four years of this President, and all he embraces, as an aberrant moment in time."" Donald Trump wasted no time firing back. ""Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe,"" . ""I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign."" Mr. Trump might be hoping otherwise. With a unifying message, Mr. Biden could be a real threat in 2020. A Morning Consult poll out Wednesday leading Mr. Trump 42% to 34%, with 19% undecided.

Mr. Sanders's faction appears to be a solid one-fifth or quarter of the Democratic electorate. This is panicking party bigwigs, who fear that Mr. Sanders would lose to Mr. Trump. Hence the hunt for a non-socialist alternative, such as Indiana's polyglot Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Mr. Biden's assets include a plain-spoken persona—a Scranton scrapper who isn't afraid to drop an occasional curse—that has appeal to Midwestern and union households. He's also popular among black voters. For people fed up with gridlock, he has a reputation as a man who can get things done.

He's an ancient pale male in a party enamored of identity politics. In 1975 he opposed school busing and racial quotas. He pushed for harsher criminal sentencing in the 1990s, warning of ""predators"" who grow up ""without any conscience developing, because they literally . . . have not been socialized."" Oh, and he gave a 2003 eulogy for a Senate colleague: Strom Thurmond. Expect that record to get a workout in the primaries. Mr. Biden is hoping Democrats ignore all that and see him as Barack Obama's wingman. He's also been adept over the years at shifting with his party's winds. In 2012 he pledged support for gay marriage before Mr. Obama did. In a speech on Martin Luther King Jr. Day this year, Mr. Biden lamented that ""systematic racism"" is ""built into every aspect of our system.""	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

He hasn't yet pronounced on the latest progressive passions. Does he back the Green New Deal? Medicare for All? A wealth tax? Free college? Reparations for slavery? Impeachment? You can bet he'll propose a big tax increase. But if he moves too much to placate Sandernistas, he will alienate moderates—and the broader electorate. What Mr. Biden may need is a Sister Souljah moment, a la Bill Clinton in 1992, to show his independence from the woke socialist left. Early signs aren't encouraging. In February Mr. Biden got into trouble with progressive activists for having the temerity to call Vice President Mike Pence a ""decent guy.""

""But my God what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can't tell the truth."" Conservatives have their own sour Biden memories. In 1987 he presided over the Supreme Court confirmation hearings that trashed legal giant Robert Bork. For years Mr. Biden advocated arms control with the Soviet Union while opposing missile defense.

Four years later he is in some ways a more appealing figure. His experience—36 years in the Senate and eight as Veep—and his low-key persona may attract voters weary of discord and early-morning tweets. Mr. Biden doesn't see comity with Republicans as complicity, and it's hard to imagine him charting America's path to socialism. In another age this would be a formidable blend, but with Democrats now inflamed by Mr. Trump, it may not be enough. The question is whether Mr. Biden can maintain his appeal while the left portrays him—but not 77-year-old Bernie—as yesterday's man.	5	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But the most important news was Senator Elizabeth Warren's determined refusal to say if her plans would require taxes to increase on the middle class. Ms. Warren, the new leader in the polls, was given at least six chances to answer yes or no. She ducked every time. ""Will you raise taxes on the middle class to pay for it, yes or no?"" asked one of the media questioners.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

She then talked about her ""70,000 selfies"" and town halls. The reporter tried again: ""Senator Warren, to be clear, Senator Sanders acknowledges he's going to raise taxes on the middle class to pay for Medicare for All. You've endorsed his plan. Should you acknowledge it, too?"" Ms. Warren: ""So the way I see this, it is about what kinds of costs middle-class families are going to face. So let me be clear on this. Costs will go up for the wealthy. They will go up for big corporations. And for middle-class families, they will go down.

He added, accurately, that ""no plan has been laid out to explain how a multi-trillion-dollar hole in this Medicare for All plan that Senator Warren is putting forward is supposed to get filled in."" Ms. Warren's third verse was same as the first: ""We can pay for this. I've laid out the basic principles. Costs are going to go up for the wealthy. They're going to go up for big corporations. They will not go up for middle-class families. And I will not sign a bill into law that raises their costs, because costs are what people care about.""	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up."" The media questioner then followed up: ""Senator Warren, will you acknowledge what the Senator just said about taxes going up?"" Ms. Warren: ""So my view on this, and what I have committed to, is costs will go down for hard-working, middle-class families.""	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

And I'm sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we're going to send the invoice."" The fifth time was not a charm as Ms. Warren again ducked the tax issue and spoke instead about Americans ""going bankrupt over health-care costs."" Joe Biden then gave it a try, but you know Ms. Warren's reply. All of this illuminates a problem with Ms. Warren's agenda and her political character. On Medicare for All, everyone agrees that the cost will be at least $32 trillion over 10 years. Ms. Warren could impose her wealth tax, her higher taxes on capital gains, her higher income taxes on the affluent, and she still wouldn't come close to paying for Medicare for All. And that's before her plans for new spending entitlements on child care, pre-K education, free college and so much more.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

That's how government health care is financed in Europe, where the rich generally provide a smaller share of overall tax revenue than they do in the U.S. Democratic voters have to decide if they want a nominee who would eliminate private health insurance while dissembling about taxes. Spinning fables is a habit for Ms. Warren. She spent years claiming to have Native American ancestry when it could help her career, only to apologize this year after the truth was exposed. More recently she said she left the workforce after having her first child because of sexism, which has been contradicted by official records and her own previous statements.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

2021-07-22	The Washington Post (Online)	Let Cubans tweet, livestream — and show the truth to the world	txt-opeds/2554146141.xml.txt	History has this maddening quality where documenting it changes its very course. We're still in the wake of what happens when footage of a fatal encounter between a Minneapolis police officer and an unarmed Black man goes viral in the collective consciousness. The unseen becoming seen changes reality itself. Communist Cuba existed as essentially an Internet-free bubble outside a radical global transformation. Until 2018 that is, when the government (which holds a monopoly on telecommunications) authorized 3G data service on smartphones. The service is still prohibitively expensive for most people and subject to censorship by the government. Still, it is a qualitative leap compared with what existed before. As I discovered reporting there in 2017, Cubans had mostly consumed the Internet by physically carrying it around, exchanging USB sticks and hard drives storing pirated content smuggled in by various means.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

What started as a spontaneous protest two Sundays ago in San Antonio de los Baños, a provincial town southwest of Havana, instantly spread to every major Cuban city, and all because of a 49-minute video shared on Facebook. From one end of the island to the other, you saw livestreamed scenes of Cubans screaming ""Freedom!"" and ""We have no fear!"" at stunned security agents, who in turn reacted swiftly and brutally. Suddenly, everyone could see how Cuba deployed club-wielding thugs alongside riot police to take on peaceful protesters. Or how police kicked the door of a family's home while a mother looked on clutching her infant, and apparently shot the child's father before dragging him away. Or how Cuban state security is now plucking people off the street in the dead of night and hauling them off to jail. Like police body cameras that revealed to a wider world the sort of abuses an unfortunate few already knew about, this sudden transparency exposed the morally bankrupt regime that Cubans and exiles abroad already knew very well.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

In this case, this social media frenzy is aimed at a fossilized Communist apparatus whose dusty rhetoric usually graces state-run newspapers. The country's youths are transforming themselves into that cadre of media influencers who define the new culture and politics elsewhere. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those same influencers are often the impromptu leaders of a protest movement that exists as much online as off. One example is Dina Stars, one of the new crop of Cuban YouTubers. She was arrested while being interviewed live for a Spanish TV show in her home; the police escorted her away for no apparent crime. Or take popular Twitter user @yousominasobuco, Ariel Falcón, who has accumulated almost 32,000 followers in a year online and who was arrested for livestreaming the gatherings.

Dina Stars and @yousominasobuco were eventually released, but many Cubans remain imprisoned or unaccounted for, with their photos being furiously shared online. This brewing battle of state vs. Internet-enabled protesters bears more than a few resemblances to similar online conflicts in our American political discourse. The Cuban government convened a ""revolutionary"" demonstration after the recent protests, exhorting the attendance of the party faithful via messaging apps (the messages were posted online). Afterward, Cuba's various embassies abroad posted deceptively framed photos of what seemed like a rowdy crowd filling Havana's seaside esplanade, and party officials claimed a 100,000-person turnout. The threads soon had Cubans trolling the official counts with amateur photos claiming a far more modest turnout.

One option could be modeled after Project Loon, an initiative by Google's parent company, Alphabet, that provided Internet to 100,000 Puerto Ricans after Hurricane Maria in 2017.

Even low unemployment doesn’t shake voters’ fears about jobs. For example, a 38-year-old mother from Wauseon, Ohio, said: “I have to work two part-time jobs to stay poor enough for Medicaid. Jobs in my area don’t provide adequate insurance to cover my daughter’s diabetes.”	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Everything was looking good, based on enormous growth in capital gains in tech stocks and property, and some in Sacramento assumed the bounty would last — until it didn’t. The latest bad news is the evaporation of the state budget surplus that is now rapidly turning into a deficit that could run as high as $22 billion to $40 billion, particularly if there’s a recession. But although there are dangers ahead, there’s no need to panic. This painful reality can be turned to our advantage and help us pivot our economy toward greater economic diversity and opportunity for most Californians, particularly ethnic minorities.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Today, property values are dropping faster in California’s three largest metropolitan areas, including the Southland, than in the rest of country, and even San Francisco’s once-thriving business district faces persistent vacancies. Meanwhile, new initial public offerings, a critical source of tax revenue, are suffering their biggest decline in two decades, and Hollywood is enduring layoffs at Disney, Warner Bros., Paramount and CBS. In 2022, stocks in media companies lost $500 billion in value, and stocks in tech firms suffered a reversal of an astounding $4 trillion.

Gavin Newsom could hand out thousands of dollars of goodies to struggling households and create massive direct subsidy programs for housing and healthcare. Continuing such largesse seems improbable. A better option is to adopt policies that reintegrate blue-collar and middle-class Californians into the economy.

California is naturally positioned to take advantage of the growing move to re-shore industries, a trend driven largely by tensions with China and supply chain issues. The good news is that industries that are most primed for re-shoring — aerospace, medical equipment, defense and electronics — are also big businesses for California. But right now, California’s regulatory and tax regimes discourage new investment compared with states like Ohio, Florida and Texas, according to a recent Hoover Institution study. President Biden’s high-tech and “green” energy initiatives could fuel growth in California, notably in fields like semiconductors and sustainable energy, water and farm policies. But although much of the semiconductor industry remains headquartered here, the new surge of chip production is taking place almost entirely in places like Ohio, New Mexico, Arizona and Texas. Similarly, most new electric vehicle and battery plants are in the nation’s heartland, the South or other locations east of the Sierra Nevada.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

""I might find it harder to vote for Bernie than for Trump,"" Blankfein, the 65-year-old former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, told the Financial Times last week. Asked about Trump's ""autocratic"" leanings, Blankfein didn't answer, pointing instead to Trump's economic accomplishments. Blankfein is hardly alone in his reluctance. Politico reports Wall Street is in a collective ""freakout"" about the septuagenarian socialist's ascendance to Democratic Party front-runner following his overwhelming victory in the Nevada caucuses this past weekend. But Blankfein's beef with Sanders is petty and personal: He doesn't like it when Sanders bashes billionaires like himself, or when he proposes things like a wealth tax.

But President Biden has introduced a new one: that the rich got windfalls during the pandemic while ordinary people suffered.

That was the peak after which things began to go downhill. By the end of the year, cumulative monthly losses of income compared with February's added up to $417 billion. At first glance, those losses appear to have been borne by the millions who lost their jobs or businesses in the pandemic. According to the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, as many as 25.3 million became newly unemployed in April, and 8.9 million were still unemployed at year-end. The job losses were concentrated among lower income earners.

The only evidence that higher earners did well in the pandemic is BLS data suggesting that incomes in the top 10% of earners grew, at most by 1.7%. That's hardly a windfall for the higher earners, but at least they kept their jobs while middle-class Americans who became unemployed lost. But this disparity has already been addressed by relief policy. The $522 billion in state unemployment benefits and federal government top-ups more than offset the $417 billion income loss. In the aggregate, the unemployed were quite literally paid 25% more not to work than to work—while the employed were paid no more to keep working.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The stimulus payments were means-tested, available fully only to persons earning under $75,000 a year and quickly phasing out for those who earn more. No windfall for the rich there. Large corporations also haven't received a pandemic windfall. To be sure, there were some winners, but there were losers too. Companies that could be expected to benefit from the need for people to shop and be entertained from home should have all been winners. According to Bloomberg, Amazon's earnings per share doubled in 2020. But where's the windfall?

Raising the corporate tax rate punishes them all, winners and losers alike. If anything, a tax break for corporations is be called for to encourage recovery. Stock prices—as distinct from earnings—have risen about 81% from the pandemic bottom on March 23, 2020. Is that a windfall? It is surely a win for the brave few who dared to put their capital at risk to buy that day. But to get that gain investors with a buy-and-hold strategy had to endure a 33.8% decline from prepandemic highs. Taking both the initial loss and the subsequent gain into account, stocks are up a more modest 19.6%, not extravagantly better than the 11.5% historical average for comparable periods.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

It's time to set aside social-justice arguments that have no economic reality. Those who were hurt in the pandemic received relief, a great deal of it, and there is more on the way—more unemployment benefits, more stimulus checks. Where's the justice in decrying people and corporations who profited by stepping up during the pandemic? Calling their well-earned profits mere windfalls demeans their service to us all.

2019-03-06	Wall Street Journal (Online)	The Trouble With Taxing Wealth; Elizabeth Warren's proposed tax on net worth seems like a nearly surgical strike at inequality, but it may not be efficient	txt-opeds/2188216517.xml.txt	Around the world, governments in recent decades have sought to lighten the burden on capital by reducing taxes on dividends, capital gains, corporate profits and wealth. The motivation is straightforward: more capital means more investment, higher productivity and faster growing wages. Capital is also highly mobile: Tax it too much, and it will go elsewhere, undermining growth. Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren has broken with that consensus by proposing a tax of 2% on net worth above $50 million and 3% above $1 billion. It may never be enacted; yet in spirit it marks a historic pivot in the focus of capital taxation, from growth to inequality.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Taxing wealth is an immensely appealing, nearly surgical strike at its most glaring manifestation. Yet it may not be an efficient response. Income consists of money received each year in the form of wages, benefits, interest, dividends, capital gains and government transfers. Wealth consists of income you've saved over your lifetime or inherited, then invested in assets such as cash, bonds, stocks, property and stakes in a business, minus debts. Wealth has always been more skewed than income and the imbalance has grown since the financial crisis. The median U.S. family's income, adjusted for inflation, fell 4% between 2007 and 2016, while its wealth plummeted 20%, according to Federal Reserve figures. For the richest 10% of families, median income rose 9% while wealth leapt 27%. More than 80% of American households had less wealth in 2016 than on the eve of the last recession, in great part because their homes, the principal asset for most families, were below their precrisis values whereas stocks, whose ownership is concentrated among the rich, have roughly doubled since 2007.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Treasury estimates that 52% of all investment income this year will flow to the richest 1% of families by income. The richest 0.1% of families are expected to earn nearly $1.5 trillion, of which 60% will be from investments. This poses a number of challenges. For the middle class, stagnant wealth limits their ability to buy a home, pay for college or respond to a financial emergency. Wealth imbalances may also undercut economic growth because assets, which typically rise in response to interest rate cuts, are concentrated among people who are less inclined to spend.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Shielding capital income leaves a big chunk of the richest families' incomes untouched by taxes, says Greg Leiserson, director of tax policy at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a left-of-center think tank. While property and some estates are already taxed, a wealth tax would hit every form of wealth. It can also be quite selective: Ms. Warren estimates only 75,000 families would pay her tax, yet it would raise $2.75 trillion over 10 years. This would create administrative headaches such as how to precisely define wealth to limit avoidance. It also would raise economic issues. It was barely a year ago that Republicans slashed the U.S. corporate tax rate to closer to international levels in hopes of juicing growth. A wealth tax would go in the opposite direction. For example, on an investment in a company averaging 8% annual returns, a shareholder may expect her holdings to grow 8% per year. A 3% wealth tax on that increase represents, on average, an implicit 37.5% income tax, on top of the corporate taxes. And unlike the corporate tax, it would have to be paid even if the company made no money that year.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

Denmark abolished its wealth tax, borne by the wealthiest 2% of families, between 1989 and 1997. In the subsequent eight years, the wealthiest families' net worth rose 30%, according to a study by Katrine Jakobsen and three co-authors distributed last year by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The authors attribute most of this to increased saving. Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, thinks this shows a U.S. wealth tax would reduce wealth and saving by enough to hurt investment and economic growth. This might be offset if the U.S. turns to foreign savings to finance an investment. This, however, means foreigners would take a bigger share of U.S. income.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

A large chunk of capital gains are never taxed because shareholders bequeath shares to their heirs without selling them. President Barack Obama proposed in one of his budgets taxing unrealized capital gains at death. Adam Looney, a Brookings Institution economist who worked on the proposal, says it would have raised roughly $200 billion over a decade. Mr. Auerbach says taxation at death seems to have less effect on the saving of the wealthy than taxation during life. An even better response would be to attack the concentration of economic power that results in monopoly-like profits by reducing barriers to competition. Competition policy, unlike tax policy, faces no trade off between equality and growth.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Eastland. This version has been corrected. At a fundraiser in New York attended by the usual Wall Street types, Joe Biden said some things that are raising eyebrows, for good reason, on two subjects. His comments on his friendly relations with segregationists are getting the most attention, but he also said something important about the wealthy people whose dollars he was seeking. Both comments are deeply problematic, and both stem from the same misconception Biden holds. Let's start here: You know, what I've found is rich people are just as patriotic as poor people. Not a joke. I mean, we may not want to demonize anybody who has made money. The truth of the matter is, you all, you all know, you all know in your gut what has to be done. We can disagree in the margins but the truth of the matter is it's all within our wheelhouse and nobody has to be punished. No one's standard of living will change, nothing would fundamentally change. Because when we have income inequality as large as we have in the United States today, it brews and ferments political discord and basic revolution. [...] It allows demagogues to step in and say the reason where we are is because of the other, the other. You're not the other. I need you very badly.

2019-06-19	The Washington Post (Online)	Biden’s comments about segregationists and the rich are deeply problematic	txt-opeds/2243237890.xml.txt	Biden knows his audience. His pitch to them is not that we must reduce inequality because it's a fundamental wrong, but because if we don't, the masses will rise up in anger and you never know what might happen then. If you want to be generous, you could argue that when he assured the well-heeled donors that ""No one's standard of living will change,"" he was telling them that they have so much money that no matter how much we raised their taxes they'd barely notice it. After all, if you have a billion dollars in assets and Elizabeth Warren's 2 percent wealth tax took effect, your taxes would go up by $20 million, which would leave you with $980 million in assets.

He believes that you can govern well without attacking the wealthy or big corporations, in both substance and rhetoric. We can all get along if we assume everyone is operating out of good will. But are they? The problems we're facing right now didn't happen by accident. Biden says he's a great friend to labor unions, but does he think that the Republicans and their corporate partners can be persuaded to abandon their war on collective bargaining with enough backslapping and reassurances that ""nothing would fundamentally change""? Or do you have to fight and defeat them because fundamental change is exactly what's necessary and they'll never agree to it?

First, Biden recounted being at a caucus with the late Mississippi Sen. James O. Eastland. Imitating his southern drawl, Biden said: ""He never called me 'boy,' he always called me 'son'."" There's a reason Eastland didn't call Biden ""boy."" That's what racists like Eastland called black men, and Biden is white. In fact, Eastland was friendly toward Biden in no small part because at the time Biden was an opponent of busing. Biden then brought up deceased Georgia Sen. Herman Talmadge and called him ""one of the meanest guys I ever knew."" Biden added: Well guess what? At least there was some civility. We got things done. We didn't agree on much of anything. We got things done. We got it finished. But today, you look at the other side and you're the enemy. Not the opposition, the enemy. We don't talk to each other anymore.	3	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-06-19	The Washington Post (Online)	Biden’s comments about segregationists and the rich are deeply problematic	txt-opeds/2243237890.xml.txt	One reason all this is so objectionable is that much of Biden's career was built on him being the kind of Democrat who could speak to and for white people who felt dispossessed by societal change, particularly around issues of race. That's also a key building block (though it goes unstated) of the suggestion that he's ""electable"" in ways other Democrats might not be. Which means that when he's running to be the presidential nominee of the party that represents pretty much all nonwhite Americans, Biden needs to be especially thoughtful about how he talks about his friendships with people like Eastland.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But let's try again to be generous to Biden. The point he was trying to make is that if he could work with a racist like Eastland to ""get things done,"" surely he can convince Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to do the same. But there's a problem with this logic, which is that Eastland and other segregationists were perfectly happy to pass legislation on any number of issues that didn't impede their agenda of white supremacy.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

When the other party is committed to that view — as today's Republican Party is — the president's good will and friendliness will change nothing.

Biden has a very particular view of how governing works and what's possible at this moment in history. He thinks his ability to get along with anyone — Republicans, billionaires, segregationists — will make his presidency successful. There is no reason, based on everything we've seen over the past couple of decades, to think he's right.

Of the $120 billion worth of housing built with federal backing between 1934 and 1962, only 2 percent was available to Black people due to ""redlining"" and other obstacles. Because agricultural and domestic workers — disproportionately Black at the time — were not covered by Social Security in 1935, Black Americans made up 23 percent of those initially left out of the program, twice their share of the total labor force.

The court has held, essentially, that such measures can amount to racial discrimination against people who are not Black.

We have mentioned some in previous editorials: direct support for first-time home buyers and for retirement savings, in place of current  tax incentives that tilt toward the upper middle class; grants for college tuition in place of loans. Each low-income child born in the United States could be staked to a federally funded $1,000 ""baby bond,"" with annual payments, varying by family income, added until age 18, as Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and others have advocated. Invested in safe government bonds, the money would accumulate tax-free. It could only be withdrawn for investment in further wealth-building purposes such as education, entrepreneurship or homebuying. An analysis by the financial research firm Morningstar suggests that ""baby bonds"" could cut the racial wealth gap in half in terms of resources available per child at age 18.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Narrowing the racial wealth gap is urgent.	txt-opeds/2556553663.xml.txt	Reform of the country's current equivalent of a wealth tax — state and local property taxes — could also foster racial equity. Recent research by finance professors Carlos Avenancio-Leon of Indiana University and Troup Howard of the University of Utah has shown that existing systems result in higher property assessment growth rates for homeowners of color relative to similarly situated White homeowners. Unjustifiably wide though it still is, the Black-White wealth gap is narrower than it was three decades ago: Median Black household wealth was 12 percent of White in 2019, but an even lower 6 percent in 1989. The lesson is that the United States has proved capable of reducing racial wealth inequality — even during a time when it was not consciously trying to do so and, in some respects, was raising new obstacles. Think how much more progress can be achieved if the country actively pursues it.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-10-12	The Washington Post (Online)	The truth about taxation in America	txt-opeds/2304403845.xml.txt	Who says economics is the dismal science? Last week saw some positively scintillating intellectual combat between marquee-name practitioners, with the social media impact measurable in hundreds of likes and retweets. What's more, there were real-world implications for how to measure a major social issue — inequality — and how to deal with it. The fireworks began when University of California at Berkeley economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman unveiled their claim that, in 2018, America's richest 400 households paid a lower effective tax rate (23 percent) than the entire bottom half of American households (24.2 percent). The finding challenged the economics profession's long-standing view that, for all its flaws, the U.S. tax system is, overall, progressive: The richer you are, the more of your income you pay. This was still true, at least for federal taxes, even after the upwardly skewed 2017 tax cuts, according to congressional experts.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-10-12	The Washington Post (Online)	The truth about taxation in America	txt-opeds/2304403845.xml.txt	The Berkeley economists reached their more concerning conclusion by factoring in such regressive state and local levies as sales tax, as well as by accounting for years and years of federal tax policy that gradually lowered corporate rates and the top tax rates rich people owe on capital income and inheritances. An estimate of the impact of the first full year of the 2017 tax bill (which took effect in 2018 so actual data aren't in yet) enabled Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman to calculate that the top 400 households now shoulder a smaller tax burden than the bottom 50 percent.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-10-12	The Washington Post (Online)	The truth about taxation in America	txt-opeds/2304403845.xml.txt	Experts who still see the system as progressive fired back. Jason Furman of Harvard, President Barack Obama's top economic adviser, pointed out that the Saez-Zucman analysis omits the refundable portion of the earned-income tax credit, a subsidy for wages delivered through the tax code that benefited 25 million mostly low-income people to the tune of about $63 billion in 2018, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The EITC, by design, offsets the most regressive levy on wage earners, Social Security taxes. David Splinter, the top analyst at Congress's bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, made similar arguments. Mr. Zucman replied, on Twitter, that including the refundable EITC would open the door to consideration of all federal transfers, such as nutritional benefits and the like; Mr. Furman, more realistically in our view, countered that EITC refunds should be included if the goal is a picture of the tax system's broad distributional effect.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

In policy terms, however, it matters which description of the problem you accept, because that choice implies how many risks — political and economic — you are willing to take to maximize taxation of the rich. Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman, who have advised Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren on her wealth tax, believe Democrats have been far too timid in the past. Yet the administration Mr. Furman served backed an expanded EITC and higher individual income tax rates, leavened by growth-enhancing corporate rate reductions (with fewer loopholes), regarding that policy mix as socially progressive, economically efficient — and politically achievable. We hope that the most recent Democratic administration's pragmatic spirit can survive the bruising debates, intellectual and otherwise, of 2020.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Incredibly, some are even leaning toward declaring Republican outrage to be reasonably grounded. Your humble blogger would like to propose that all of us covering this ask ourselves a simple, guiding question: What sort of inquiry into Jan. 6 would Republicans declare to be a legitimate one? If the answer to this question is unsatisfactory to media figures — that is, if what constitutes a legitimate inquiry in the eyes of Republicans is not something they would see as reasonable or acceptable — then it must follow that Republicans are to blame for the failure to achieve a bipartisan investigation, by the lights of media figures themselves.	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-07-22	The Washington Post (Online)	The huge, gaping hole in our media discussion of the GOP and Jan. 6	txt-opeds/2554143001.xml.txt	First, let's note that the idea that the investigation into Jan. 6 must be bipartisan is something many media figures are themselves treating as an important civic goal. News accounts are widely casting the inability to achieve one as an inherent failure. The bare-bones chronology is that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) nixed two of McCarthy's choices — Reps. Jim Banks (R-Ind.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) — from serving on the committee. McCarthy then pulled his nominations of all other Republicans and declared none would serve. The conventions of political reporting require that this is portrayed as a battle between equivalently motivated partisans: It's a ""partisan fight"" or a ""partisan brawl"" or an escalation of ""political tensions"" or an ""inability"" to achieve a ""bipartisan committee.""	1	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

They validated the lies that inspired the insurrection in the first place. In short: Pelosi did not allow them to serve on the committee because their openly telegraphed goal was to sabotage the committee. McCarthy then angrily pulled out, insisting that this showed Pelosi is the one who doesn't want a real accounting. But McCarthy picked Banks and Jordan so that they would carry out the goal of sabotaging that accounting.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

But some media figures have found a way around this. Whatever the specifics, they say, it's important to allow McCarthy to have his choices so that it's perceived as bipartisan and seen as credible by Republican voters. ""Pelosi's move will make the investigation even easier to dismiss for people who aren't die-hard members of Team Blue,"" Politico's Playbook insists, stressing the importance of making it ""credible to the right.""

Banks suggested the investigation should ascribe more importance to the riots associated with police protest than to the Jan. 6 mob assault. McCarthy, for his part, has claimed that Republicans will run their own investigation now. On Fox News, he hinted where this might lead, asking: ""Was there a decision made by the Speaker not to have the National Guard at the Capitol that day?"" Similarly, Jordan has asked whether Pelosi failed to supply adequate security at the Capitol. Those suggestions are all nonsense. Pelosi did not make any such decision about the National Guard, and the speaker doesn't control Capitol security.

Republicans on two Senate committees would not endorse a report on security lapses until the language was negotiated down to vastly minimize the role of Trump's lies in inciting the rioters and to downplay their express goal of overturning the election. The huge hole in this debate is that many media figures do not seem to be publicly wrestling with whether those types of GOP requirements for an investigation into Jan. 6 are reasonable or defensible ones. That question requires a value judgment. If it's okay to make the value judgment that failing to achieve a bipartisan investigation is inherently a blameworthy thing, then it should also be okay to make a value judgment about whether Republican conditions for a bipartisan investigation are reasonable or defensible.	5	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

By the end of Obama’s eight years, G.D.P. growth was still disappointing. Middle-class and poor families were still receiving less than their fair share of that growth. Median household wealth was lower than it had been two decades earlier. In the most shocking sign of struggle, average life expectancy has declined in recent years. Rich Americans, on the other hand, continue to thrive, amassing Gilded Age-level concentrations of wealth. The resulting frustration helped make possible the rise of Donald Trump.

Her platform aims to reform American capitalism so that it once again works well for most American families. The recent tradition in Democratic politics has been different. It has been largely to accept that big companies are going to get bigger and do everything they can to hold down workers’ pay. The government will then try to improve things through income taxes and benefit programs. Warren is trying to treat not just the symptoms but the underlying disease. She has proposed a universal child-care and pre-K program that echoes the universal high school movement of the early 20th century. She favors not only a tougher approach to future mergers, as many Democrats do, but also a breakup of Facebook and other tech companies that have come to resemble monopolies.

One, Warren’s grasp of the country’s problems does not necessarily mean that she should be the Democratic nominee for president. Politics is not an expertise competition. The nominee should be, and most likely will be, the candidate who best inspires voters. Maybe that will be Warren, or maybe it will be someone else. Two, I don’t agree with all of Warren’s proposals.

Her plans are also much more detailed than those of Bernie Sanders (who, to his credit, pushed the party to become bolder).

In the months to come, I hope that every other 2020 candidate offers answers to the questions that Warren has taken on: How can corporate America again help create a prosperous, growing middle class, as it did from the 1940s through the 1970s? How can the power of giant corporations — over consumers, workers and smaller businesses — be constrained? How can the radical levels of wealth inequality be reversed?

The main theme in her life, both professional and personal, has been economic opportunity. Her father was a carpet salesman at Montgomery Ward in Oklahoma City in the 1960s, until he had a heart attack. He had to switch to lower-paying work as a janitor, and her mother got a minimum-wage job, answering phones at Sears. Warren’s three older brothers all went into the military. “That was their chance to make it into the middle class,” she told me. Warren went to college and became a teacher, until the school chose not to renew her contract rather than give her maternity leave.

As a professor in the 1990s, she served on a federal bankruptcy commission and fought against legal changes that favored banks over borrowers. The fight went on for a decade, and Warren’s side lost. The defeat left her believing that a technocratic legislative debate — “the inside game,” as she calls it — almost always favors industry lobbyists.	8	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The idea was new. It was also simple enough for voters to understand. She hawked it on “The Daily Show With Jon Stewart.” This time, Warren’s side won. Trump has since constrained the agency, but it still exists and is still doing good. Those experiences help explain why Warren thinks that bigger changes are sometimes more feasible than modest ones. Bigger changes — tangible, new ideas — can overcome voter cynicism. “A lot of people don’t believe you can actually make any change on economics,” Warren says. I would add another, even larger, example to the pattern: Obamacare. Trump has undone many of Obama’s more modest changes, on taxes, climate and other areas. But Obama’s grandest accomplishment endures. For all its flaws, it proved too popular to kill.	9	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

She isn’t pushing for a byzantine system of tax credits for child care. She wants a universal program of pre-K and child care, administered locally, with higher pay for teachers and affordable tuition for families. And to anyone who asks, “But how will you pay for that?” Warren has an answer. Her wealth tax would raise more than $250 billion a year, about four times the estimated cost of universal child care. She is, in her populist way, the fiscal conservative in the campaign. The wealth-tax proposal has shifted the national debate more than any other 2020 proposal so far. It has made people realize the most middle-class families pay an annual tax on their largest asset — called the property tax. But the wealthy do not, because financial holdings aren’t taxed the way real estate is. Some center-left economists have criticized a wealth tax as too disruptive, potentially threatening some family-owned businesses, but many others have praised it. “This type of wealth tax,” Gene Sperling, the former top economic adviser to Obama and both Clintons, has said, “is essential.”	10	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Elon Musk didn't pay federal income tax at all in 2018? Okay. America's billionaires pay a lower tax rate than the working class? Didn't we hear this last year? The most shocking thing about ProPublica's extensive report on the leaked tax returns of the super-rich wasn't what the report contained — it was the fact that we're barely shocked anymore. After examining a trove of tax returns spanning more than 15 years, the journalism nonprofit reported this week that America's billionaires were legally keeping their tax bills low by declaring minuscule amounts of taxable income relative to their rapidly expanding fortunes. ProPublica calculated that from 2014 to 2018, the 25 richest Americans paid taxes equal to only 3.4 percent of their gain in wealth. But if multibillionaires pay, as a share of their net worth, virtually nothing in income taxes — and sometimes pay nothing at all — we, as a society, let them do it.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

But more than that, every billionaire is a failure of our own moral imagination. Most of the response to the ProPublica report has been to argue about how to tinker with our current tax regime. In response to enormous displays of inequality, we trot out new stratagems to make billionaires toss us back just a few dollars more. Should we tax capital gains at a higher rate? Raise the corporate tax rate? Create a wealth tax? (I'd vote yes to all three.) But these debates are small bore. They won't do away with wealth inequality of a truly incomprehensible kind — the sort that allows Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos (who also owns The Post) to engage in their own private space race while a global pandemic pushes more than 100 million people into extreme poverty.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Doing so would require a revised conception of what is good and what is fair, an approach focused less on what is ""allowed"" and more on what is ""enough."" Does that sound far-fetched? Such a philosophy already exists. It's called limitarianism. As the director of the Fair Limits Project at Utrecht University in the Netherlands, philosopher Ingrid Robeyns argues that it is not morally permissible to have ""more resources than are needed to fully flourish in life."" Just as there is a poverty line under which we agree that no one should fall, limitarianism holds that one can construct a ""wealth line"" over which no one should rise, and that the world would be better off for it.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

The crucial point is to debate not where the line can be drawn, but whether it makes sense. And just considering this idea forces a radical, and exciting, revision of how we consider the problems of inequality that ProPublica's reporting reveals, and pushes us to ask new questions about the axioms by which we have agreed to live. For instance: What does it say about us that we have agreed to live with chasms so vast, and that we continue to ignore the connection between extreme wealth and immiseration? Why do we so commonly assume that material wealth is a clear signifier of worth?	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Bezos and other billionaires may be uncommonly smart, talented and hard-working, but it's doubtful they work that much harder than everyone else. Why do we assume that individuals should be allowed to keep as much as they can grab, and how responsible are we for one another?

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as the dominant figure on the most progressive wing of the party. On Monday, the Morning Consult poll shows she has ticked up two points to 18 percent while Sanders has stayed flat at 20 percent. In addition, Working Families Party, a pro-union progressive group, which backed Sanders in 2016, endorsed Warren. Its endorsement explained, ""Medicare for All. A Green New Deal. A groundbreaking wealth tax that will begin to rebalance the scales of our economy. Universal childcare. That is the Elizabeth Warren agenda, and we are proud to support it.""

Sanders also has overhauled his New Hampshire operation. Warren is simply a younger, brighter, cheerier candidate than Sanders with a much better campaign operation. Other than fear of a female candidate, it is hard to figure out why voters would approve the older, crankier candidate with campaign problems. However, Warren's ceiling may be lower than is necessary to win the nomination. The increase in Warren's support in the Morning Consult poll has been largely driven by ""four groups: the most engaged primary voters, those over the age of 65, white liberals and college-educated whites."" That would be people just like her. By vacuuming up all those voters, she may well pass Sanders (and has in some polls). However, if you assume Sanders will remain in the race with some core base of support (as he did in 2016), it's hard to see how Warren prevails.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The Biden who spoke at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., on Sunday holds the support (for now) of African American voters; the Biden in the debates doesn't seem to register. One silver lining for Warren: She has doubled her share of African American voters from 5 to 10 percent. Moreover, she is doggedly seeking to pursue these voters with a number of policy initiatives.

Once more we see that flashy debate performances (e.g., Beto O'Rourke) and direct attacks on Biden (Julián Castro) do nothing to change the trajectory of the race.

During the primary, Mr. Biden set a goal of net-zero carbon emissions for the economy by 2050, much less ambitious than Mr. Sanders, who targeted net zero for power and transportation by 2030.

Some of the goodwill generated with business by those policies and appointments, though, has been eroded by his trade actions against China and U.S. allies and the atmosphere of division and chaos that accompanies his economic decisions. Lloyd Blankfein, former chief executive of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a Democrat who was critical of both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, tweeted last month: ""So far the stock market doesn't seem too upset at the prospect of Biden winning, despite Trump's more market-friendly policies.

Energy companies are resigned to more climate regulation in a Biden administration, said Kevin Book, head of research at ClearView Energy Partners, an energy analysis firm. In Thursday's final debate, Mr. Biden said he would ""transition away from the oil industry."" Yet much will depend on who fills key positions such as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Mr. Book pointed to Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under Mr. Obama and has advised the Biden campaign, as someone the industry felt listened even if they didn't like her decisions.

Barring a recession or foreign crisis, they will want a return to presidential normalcy, not a ""transformation"" of the U.S. economy or a return to the liberal cultural imperialism of Barack Obama's second term. If they decide to vote for change, they want it to be reassuring, not radical. Joe Biden is the most prominent of the candidates who seem to understand this, which is one reason he continues to lead in the polls despite what the press is portraying as his recent stumbles. The question is whether the former Vice President can stand up against the ""woke"" assaults against his record and political style, and the debates will be an important test.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The more he apologizes for his past, or abandons his previous policy views, the weaker and less presidential he will sound. His flip-flop on taxpayer funding for abortion was a mistake because it made him look pliable on a moral position he'd held for 45 years. He also shouldn't apologize for his vote on a crime bill from 25 years ago merely to serve the identity politics of today. He can say the bill was needed at the time and that many then in the Black Caucus supported it because crime was a particular blight on minority neighborhoods. The bill is one reason crime is lower today, which is why we can afford to have different policies. If Mr. Biden folds under pressure from the left, voters will learn something about his leadership as President.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

They're now splitting the progressive vote, with Senator Warren gaining in the polls with the white gentry liberals who make more than $100,000 a year. She's also the new darling of the progressive pundit class, who like her specific ideas for wealth redistribution (a French-style wealth tax) and yoking corporations to more political control (making them answer to ""stakeholders"" not shareholders). If one of the two breaks into a substantial lead on the other, the odds of a left-wing nominee increase. The party's progressive wing thinks left-wing populism is necessary to defeat Mr. Trump's right-wing variety. We think that's a bad bet, and certainly a risky one if your priority is defeating Mr. Trump. Our guess is that either Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Warren would have a hard time defeating Mr. Trump because their economic policies will rightly scare moderate voters in the suburbs.	3	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

And will anyone challenge the excesses of identity politics and the Democratic habit of denigrating Donald Trump's voters as ""deplorables"" or worse? At this stage of his Presidency, Mr. Trump is arguably the most politically vulnerable first-term incumbent since Jimmy Carter. But as Democrats learned the hard way in 2016, even an unpopular candidate can win if his opponent is even more unacceptable.

A new op-ed on this theme, penned for the Tuesday Wall Street Journal by Home Depot co-founder Bernard Marcus and New York supermarket magnate John Catsimatidis, sets a standard for the genre that other tycoons will shoot for in vain.

Its second sentence reads, ""We have earned more money than we could have imagined and more than we can spend on ourselves, our children and grandchildren."" Then comes sentence 4: ""But we have nothing to apologize for, and we don't think the government should have more of our profits.""

The answer is a common one in essays like this: They'll decide for themselves. ""We know we can spend our dollars more wisely, and in ways that benefit our communities and our country, than politicians can,"" they write. (My mother would paraphrase their theme as ""I like me, who do you like?"") This is the crux of the billionaire's anti-tax screed the world over, so it's worth examining in detail.

The Empire State is struggling compared with other states; the Sunshine State is booming."" This is a masterpiece of cherry-picking. Yes, since the last recession Florida's economy has grown faster than New York's. But that's hardly the whole story.

The authors make their case in part by citing their philanthropic endeavors. They say they have ""given more than $2 billion to charitycauses ranging from the American Cancer Society to the Salvation Army, from museums and operas to veterans programs, homeless assistance and private schools in inner cities for at-risk kids.""

In short, infrastructure and services that government funds from tax revenue. Can the charitable efforts at homeless assistance and private schooling in inner cities that Catsimatidis and Marcus crow over fill the funding gap for public programs? Plainly not. The authors also boast about ""our enterprises...helping cure terrible and painful diseases from cancer to multiple sclerosis."" For perspective, consider that the single biggest funding agency of biomedical research in the world is the National Institutes of Health. The budget for the NIH, however, has consistently come under attack by the Trump administration, which this year proposed to cut it by $5 billion, or 13%. The White House said the cuts reflected ""priorities,"" implying that they were made necessary by budgetary stringency -- fostered, in part, by the massive tax cuts enacted to benefit Catsimatidis and Marcus and their ""enterprises.""	6	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Forbes pegs Marcus' net worth at $5.6 billion. and Catsimatidis' at a measly $3.1 billion. So they could step in if they chose to spend almost all their money on this one effort, but that would leave nothing for museums, operas, etc. They say that ""when we look at the way government spends its money, we are frustrated by the waste and the ineffectiveness of so many of its programs, however well-intentioned."" This is the all-purpose dodge trotted out by every anti-tax warrior in existence, from the loftiest billionaire to the lowliest militiaman.

Marcus and Catsimatidis bolster their claim to perfect knowledge about how to spend their money by referring to their businesses, which they call ""our legacies.""

Home Depot was a beneficiary of the Republican tax cut of December 2017, which was supposed to bring prosperity to all Americans. The company followed the tax cut with one of the biggest stock buybacks in corporate America, a $15-billion handout to shareholders. Employees, not so much. The company said the tax cut allowed it to pay bonuses of up to $1,000 to its workforce, but these turned out to be largely chimerical. Only workers with 20 years of service at the company would get the full $1,000, which would work out to about 48 cents an hour for full-time work. Others would receive as little as $200.

Virginia is notably hostile to labor unions. It’s one of only three states to ban government workers from bargaining collectively, and it also puts legal obstacles in the way of private sector unions. Not surprisingly, after Democrats took control of Virginia’s state legislature this year, they began considering a bill to make it easier for unions to enroll workers. Economic research has found that unionized workers earn roughly 15 percent more on average than otherwise similar workers who aren’t in a union.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

One big factor appears to have been an economic analysis by a local business development group predicting that the bill would hurt the state’s economy. And what was the group’s evidence for the claim? A survey of local business executives and consultants, who said they liked Virginia’s hostility to unions and predicted the bill would damage the economy.

2020-02-13	New York Times (Online)	Democrats for Low Wages	txt-opeds/2354024947.xml.txt	Nobody should be surprised that corporate executives prefer weak unions and low wages. Low wages increase their profits, and executives tend to be judged — and paid — based on their companies’ profitability. The mistake that the Virginia legislature made was confusing the well-being of executives with the well-being of the state’s economy. They’re not the same thing. If the legislature wanted an objective view of the benefits and drawbacks of labor unions, it should have looked to a more objective source — like, say, a broad range of academic research. Too often, policymakers (and the media, too) treat business leaders as disinterested experts, rather than what they are — an interest group. Yes, corporate executives sometimes favor policies that are good for themselves and good for the country. Often, though, they are mainly concerned with their own well-being and justify their arguments with dubious claims about the greater good.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

2019-10-24	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s math on Medicare-for-all better add up	txt-opeds/2308354299.xml.txt	After dodging repeated questions from interviewers and in the recent Democratic debate as to how she is going to pay for Medicare-for-all, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has promised she will look at how to pay for it. On Sunday according to CNN, she pledged, ""I've been working for months and months, and it's got just a little more work until it's finished, but I want to bring this out."" She added, ""I think there have been many estimates about what the cost will be, and many different payment streams, and I've been working on how to give the exact details to make that work.'	0	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but promised not to increase total costs for the middle class. (Total cost is a slippery concept, since some people use a lot of medical services and others do not. Would the total bill go up for middle-class workers who use health-care services only sparingly?) Sanders has conceded that he would apply a 4 percent tax to everyone making at least $29,000 and would also enact a new 7.5 percent payroll tax, which would in part be shouldered by middle-class workers (if paid by the employer, it is reasonable to assume that the result would be lower pay for workers to account for the new expense). Beyond that, MarketWatch reports, ""Sanders proposes a variety of progressive tax changes, including imposing a marginal tax rate of up to 70% on those making above $10 million, taxing earned and unearned income at the same rates, limiting tax deductions for filers in the top tax bracket, establishing a tax on extreme wealth and making the estate tax more progressive, including a 77% top rate on an inheritance above $1 billion.""	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-10-24	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s math on Medicare-for-all better add up	txt-opeds/2308354299.xml.txt	The tricky part here is that Warren has promised that ""costs"" for the middle class will not go up and she has already put out a wealth tax to pay for all her other programs (e.g. child care, free college), so that money cannot be double-counted. Fortunately, the progressive Urban Institute recently put out a study on various health-care plans. The kind of enhanced single-payer plan Sanders and Warren are talking about includes ""eliminating all cost-sharing requirements, adding additional benefits for adult dental, vision, and hearing care and LTSS [long-term services and supports]. Because the single-payer (or Medicare for All) proposals currently being discussed would provide coverage to undocumented immigrants, we include all US residents in these estimates."" The Urban Institute finds: ""Net federal government health spending, accounting for savings from eliminating Medicare, Marketplace subsidies, the acute-care portion of Medicaid, and uncompensated care, as well as savings on other federal insurance programs, increases by $2.8 trillion in 2020. Offsetting increases in income tax revenue mean $2.7 trillion in additional federal revenue is needed to finance the new program."" That is for a single year. It does not include a calculation as to how much more in health-care services people will use when they are essentially free.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE
2019-10-24	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s math on Medicare-for-all better add up	txt-opeds/2308354299.xml.txt	In short, the Urban Institute concludes that an enhanced Medicare-for-all program requires additional federal spending of $34 trillion over 10 years, a mere $32 trillion after tax offsets. Other analysts come to slightly different results. Kenneth E. Thorpe of Emory (who advised the failed Medicare-for-all program in Vermont) found that ""the new federal revenues needed would exceed $32 Trillion over the next decade, Senator Sanders has himself stated that the Federal budgetary cost would be over $30 trillion over a decade."" Thorpe explained: The Vermont version was a less generous version of Medicare for All (they retained cost sharing of 6 to 13 percent). However, the estimates produced by state and others found that it would require a 9.5 percent increase in income taxes and a new 11.5 percent payroll tax so overall a combined middle-class tax increase of 21 percent. A Medicare for All plan when fully implemented would require even larger tax increases given the elimination of all cost sharing. ... All of Sanders options together raise about $15 trillion over ten years – far short of the over $30 trillion he proposes to pay for this. He admits that there would be middle-class tax increases required but has not outlined what they are.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The analysis shows that 71 percent of households with private insurance today would pay more in new taxes than they would save through the elimination of premiums and cost sharing."" And remember, Warren has already ruled out applying those taxes to middle-class Americans if it means their total cost goes up. The middle class cannot escape scot-free. ""For example, two-thirds of workers in small firms under 50 would pay more in taxes under a Medicare for All plan than they would save in the elimination of premiums and cost sharing,"" Thorpe found. ""The tax increases would also hit the middle class. Two-thirds of families of 4 earning $50,000 to $75,000 would pay more in taxes than they would save through a Medicare for All plan. Overall over 10 million households earning between 200 and 300 percent of poverty would pay more in taxes than they would save through the elimination of premiums and cost sharing. Overall nearly 70 million households would pay more in higher taxes than they would save under Medicare for All.""	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Medicare for All advocates point out that paying providers at Medicare rates and administrative savings would reduce what we spend on health care. That ignores the fundamental equation that expenditures equal income. For example, paying the over 5,000 community hospitals at Medicare rates would reduce their revenue by 16 percent and eliminate 1.5 million jobs. Hospitals are often the largest employer in many small and mid-size communities that reductions of this magnitude would have enormous economic and social implications for them. The elimination of private insurance would also result in lost jobs through the elimination of health insurance, by some estimates nearly 1 million in the health insurance industry.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

2021-09-27	New York Times (Online)	Biden Versus the Rip Van Winkle Caucus	txt-opeds/2576712431.xml.txt	What’s going on? Contrary to legend, many of the balking Democrats don’t come from swing districts; anyway, the Biden economic agenda is popular almost everywhere. For example, its main elements command overwhelming support in West Virginia. Furthermore, does anyone really imagine that the outcome of the midterm elections will depend on whether the eventual package, if there is one, is $3.5 trillion or $1.5 trillion? We can, of course, invoke the usual suspects: Corporate money and wealthy donors are surely having an impact. But I was struck by something Eric Levitz of New York magazine said in a recent article on this subject, which helped clarify a point I’ve been groping toward.

Specifically, some Democrats still seem to believe that they can succeed economically and politically by being Republicans lite. It’s doubtful whether that was ever true. But it’s definitely not true now. On the economic side, there was a widespread perception in the late 1990s that the harshness of American social policy — our high level of inequality, our lack of a European-style social safety net — was to a large extent vindicated by economic success. When Bill Clinton declared in 1996 that “the era of big government is over,” it looked as if small government was being rewarded with a booming economy. We were surging ahead technologically and outpacing the rest of the advanced world on job creation; it’s hard to grasp now the sense of American triumphalism that pervaded elite opinion circa 2000.	2	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The technology-led productivity boom that began in the mid-1990s petered out a decade later. And America never did establish a durable technological lead; at this point, to take one visible measure, many European nations have faster and cheaper internet access than we do. U.S. job creation has also lost its luster: prime-age European adults are as likely to be working as their U.S. counterparts. Beyond economics, in the 1990s many Democrats believed that they could mollify noncollege white voters through a combination of validating rhetoric — denouncing Sister Souljah, talking tough on crime — and cuts in programs widely perceived to mainly benefit Black people. Clinton really did end Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the program most people meant when they talked about “the bums on welfare,” without providing any real replacement.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

If this antagonism reflected the perception that many able-bodied Black men who should have been working weren’t, it should have faded when the problem of prime-age men not working (and the social disruptions that appear to go along with lack of jobs) became as severe in overwhelmingly white rural areas as in inner cities. It didn’t. Instead, the voting behavior of white working-class voters seems more driven by racial resentment than ever.

Republicans will still portray them as socialists who want to defund the police, and the voters they’re trying to pander to will believe it. So my plea to Democratic “moderates” is, please wake up. We’re not in 1999 anymore, and your political fortunes depend on helping Joe Biden govern effectively.	5	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Berman began by claiming that ""socialism in the United States is prominent in a way it hasn't been in decades,"" but Gallup's November 2018 poll found that 54 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted the party to become ""more moderate,"" while only 41 percent wanted it to be more liberal. (Note: Fifty-seven percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents wanted a more conservative Republican Party.) At a minimum, Berman's hope for social democracy in the United States is most premature. Berman asserted that ""social democracy has arguably been the single most successful modern ideology or political movement,"" but that ignored the country that was the most social democratic in the 20th century. From 1947 through 1991, India had the purest form of social democracy, and the nation suffered with slow economic growth (about 3 percent). More than 60 percent of the rural population lived in poverty. Social democracy delivered only misery and deprivation. (Since 1991, when market-driven reforms were implemented, India's gross domestic product has been increasing by more than 7 percent.)	0	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Sweden's GDP growth rate averaged only 0.56 percent from 1981 through 2018. Moreover, Berman made no mention of Sweden's 2009 stimulus, which used permanent tax cuts rather than bailouts or debt-financed social spending. Since 2000, Sweden has abandoned its wealth tax, eliminated its property tax, reduced corporate income taxes and made sharp cuts to unemployment benefits. This lends little support to Berman's claims. Richard W. Burcik, Malvern, Pa.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

Bernie Sanders's (I-Vt.) entry into the race. Despite running second in most early polls, Sanders is likely to find that he can't recapture the magic once he goes back out on tour. Sanders's 2016 debut effort was the definition of catching lightning in a bottle. His fiery progressive populism resonated among the Democratic left and the young, both of whom hungered for a different tune. Hillary Clinton had scared every other significant competitor out of the race but proved to be an especially poor campaigner unable to find a convincing rationale for her candidacy.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — who goes by the stage name ""AOC"" — launches ""The Green New Deal,"" and suddenly he's the one covering someone else's tune. Progressive politics is hot, and like the disco era in the late 1970s, it seems there's a new successful act every minute. We see that bevy of imitators charting in the polls. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) has moved into a close third in most polls and has the benefit of being a younger person of color — a fresh act, so to speak. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has her fans and is releasing new, original work of her own, such as a wealth tax and a national child-care plan.

2019-02-19	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders is probably just another one-hit wonder	txt-opeds/2183439033.xml.txt	History shows this is likely to seriously hurt Sanders. CNN's Harry Enten has compiled a list of every candidate who finished second in one year's primaries and chose to run again the next time. He found that only six of those 13 people won the nomination in his next race, and only one of those (John McCain in 2008) became their party's pick without leading the polls in February of the year before the election. The fact that Sanders runs second now is a strong indicator that he will not be the nominee in 2020. Sanders seems most similar to two people who fared extremely poorly in their next efforts, Eugene McCarthy and Rick Santorum. McCarthy's rise to fame was a lot like Sanders's: He was an obscure senator who challenged a seemingly unbeatable leader (President Lyndon B. Johnson) and attracted young voters and liberals with his anti-Vietnam War stance. His lightning in the bottle forced LBJ to drop out in 1968, but when he tried to attract support on his own in 1972, a younger imitator, Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.), attracted his voters with a broader left-wing and anti-war appeal. McCarthy finished fifth.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Languishing in the polls as late as January, the former senator from Pennsylvania rocketed to win the Iowa caucuses on the strength of religious conservatives who did not want to nominate Mitt Romney. He rode their backing to finish second, but when he tried again in 2016, religious conservatives looked for the fresh face. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and noted neurosurgeon Ben Carson thrashed Santorum among Iowa's religious conservatives. The man who won the state in 2012 received less than 1 percent in 2016 and quickly dropped out. Sanders's chances are slim even if he regains progressive support from his competitors. While his backers contend that the Democratic establishment rigged the 2016 race in Clinton's favor, the fact is Sanders lost because he got wiped out among African American voters. This is a long-standing problem for white, progressive challengers to the Democratic establishment. Since 1984, African American Democratic primary voters have either supported a serious African American candidate or the more moderate among the white candidates. Sanders would face the same challenge that doomed him in 2016 and has shown no indication that he has figured out how to meet it.	3	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

The rate would comprise 39.6%, nearly doubling the current top rate of 20%, and the 3.8% net investment surtax imposed on taxpayers earning more than $250,000 (for joint filers) by the Affordable Care Act. Biden would reportedly also raise the top marginal rate on ordinary income to the same 39.6% from the current 37%, which this year is paid by joint filers with income of more than $628,300 and single filers with income of more than $523,600. By effectively extinguishing the capital gains preference, Biden would be crossing the tax Rubicon. No wonder that stock investors expressed their dismay with what almost seems like panic selling.

Biden could announce a proposal on the capital gains tax next week, Bloomberg reported, with the goal of using the tax to fund part of his infrastructure program. For those subject to the tax, there’s a lot to love about it. For the rest of us, it’s a scourge. The capital gains tax chiefly benefits the rich, which imposes a commensurate burden on other taxpayers. It has become a tool allowing excessive wealth to be passed on to future generations, which exacerbates wealth inequality. It’s often defended as economically justified, but whether that’s true is debatable.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

That sticks in the craw of many working Americans, as it should. The full details of the plan being considered at the White House, as Bloomberg set it forth, are murky. Just raising the rate would open the door to more legal circumvention of the tax.

According to the Federal Reserve, the top 10% of Americans by wealth owned 88.5% of all stocks and mutual funds. On the surface, the capital gains tax looks simple. You declare your gross income from the sale of stocks, bonds and other capital assets and subtract what you paid for them to get the net gain. That’s subject to a top rate of 20%, as long as you’ve held the asset for more than a year. (If not, then the gain is taxed at the higher rate of ordinary income.)	4	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

In 2021, couples with income below $80,800 and single filers with income below $40,400 pay no capital gains tax. Those with income between $80,800 and $501,600 pay only 15% on capital gains (the range for singles is $40,400 to $445,850). But that gives only a hint of why the wealthy love the capital gains tax.

That’s because no one has to pay it until they sell the asset. If they hold it until their death, their heirs pay nothing, thanks to the “step-up” in basis for inherited wealth. To illustrate, say your father bought a share of stock for $10 (his “cost basis”) that grew in value to $20. If he sold it while alive, he’d pay a tax on the $10 gain. If he kept it and willed it to you upon his death, its cost basis becomes $20 and you could sell it at that price without paying any tax. The capital gains tax just disappears.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

Nothing about this keeps stock owners from exploiting the embedded value of their holdings without selling. They can borrow against their stocks and bonds or sell options against them, for example. The capital gains differential is one tax break that isn’t capped, unlike deductions for mortgage interest or state and local taxes. The story of its value to the wealthy is told in the annual statistics published by the IRS. According to the latest edition, covering the 2019 tax year, taxpayers with $10 million or more in income reported an average of $15 million in income from capital gains. Middle-class taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 to $200,000 reported average capital gains of $10,750.	7	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

That’s because interest is deductible on mortgages only up to $750,000 (the limit was $1 million before the 2017 tax changes), whatever one’s income. Another important aspect of capital gains is that they become a larger component of income as one climbs the income ladder. On average, taxpayers reporting income of $10 million or more claimed about 57% of their income as capital gains or as stock dividends also subject to the low capital gains rate in 2019; only 16.9% of their income was reported as wages or salary.	8	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

These figures explain much of the politicking that has gone on over the capital gains tax and other taxes enjoyed mostly by the wealthy. Back in 2016, numerous affluent Americans came out in favor of abolishing the so-called carried interest tax loophole. This loophole allowed investment fund managers to treat much of the income they collected from their funds’ profitable investments as capital gains. The loophole was enjoying its moment in the sun as a tax controversy, which allowed advocates of its abolition to seem public-spirited. (“Close my tax loophole,” wrote one investment manager in a New York Times op-ed.) Even then-presidential candidate Donald Trump said he favored abolition.	9	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

It was enjoyed only by a small subset of the top 1%, anyway, “so it makes sense to offer it up to quell popular dissatisfaction with how the tax system is operating.” The loophole never was abolished, anyway. Capital gains constitute such an immense portion of wealthy taxpayers’ earnings that they never seem to cease demanding that it be made even more generous. One perennial demand is to index the rate to inflation, on the argument that most capital gains are due to inflation and it’s unfair to charge stockholders for those gains. Anti-tax advocates have even taken a stab at labeling the capital gains tax the “inflation tax.” Among the promoters of this campaign was the Tax Foundation, which has been heavily supported by the Koch network.	10	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Whether Biden will follow through on what appears to be a strategically leaked policy draft and raise the capital gains tax is anybody’s bet. The proposal wouldn’t be complete unless it includes an end to the step-up in cost basis to heirs.

Griffin ranked high on ProPublica’s list. The news organization found that he had “averaged an annual income of $1.7 billion from 2013 to 2018,” making him the fourth-highest income-earner in the country. His average tax rate was 29.2% in those years, ProPublica reported. That’s considerably lower than the top marginal tax rate, which currently is 37% on income over about $578,000 for single taxpayers. (Griffin, according to the latest biographical material, is divorced.)

Indeed, a spokesperson for Griffin acknowledged, as ProPublica reported last year, that his tax rate was “lowered by charitable contributions,” among other factors. The dirty little secret about how plutocrats finance the charitable deductions that get their names on distinguished institutions is only one aspect of Griffin’s gift that should concern all Americans. More broadly, it points to the wisdom of a wealth tax on American millionaires and billionaires.

The announcement of a major donation on the scale of Griffin’s is typically accompanied by an accounting of the donor’s other charitable efforts. Usually, however, what passes for selfless charity is a mask for the rich to fund their personal hobby horses. A classic example of this identified in 2012 by then-Reuters columnist Felix Salmon (now at Axios) was a $100-million gift to the Central Park Conservancy of New York by hedge fund boss John Paulson — who happened to live a few doors down from the park.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

In some cases, big donors get credit for saving institutions from financial quagmires resulting from the sort of tax breaks the donors have enjoyed.

One is lobbying to keep and augment their tax breaks. In 2020, for instance, Griffin contributed $54 million to a campaign fighting an Illinois ballot measure that would have raised the state’s marginal tax rate on incomes higher than $750,000 to about 8% from 5%.

J.B. Pritzker (also a billionaire) “seek to shift even more hard-earned taxpayer money into the hands of politicians who have consistently proven to be irresponsible stewards,” he wrote. “I’m willing to stand up for what is right.” He wasn’t willing to stay, however. The following year, Griffin moved his family and the headquarters of his Citadel hedge fund and Citadel Securities firm to Miami from Chicago. Griffin said tax considerations weren’t at issue, but unlike Illinois, Florida has no personal income tax. Since his move, he has become a major financial supporter of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

That ostensibly nonprofit institution has an endowment of more than $50 billion, the largest in the country. On what planet can a taxpayer-subsidized addition to this endowment be justified? We raised the same issue back in 2016, when Nike founder Phil Knight collected plaudits for making a $400-million gift to Stanford University, where he received a business degree.

A 2015 data survey by Nexus Research placed the discrepancy in stark relief by comparing the implicit per-student subsidy at rich private institutions with the government funding of public colleges in their state. In California, it showed that Stanford received about $63,000 per student, while UC Berkeley got $10,500, Cal State Fullerton got $4,000 and Fullerton Community College $8,100.

According to a 2015 survey by the Council for Aid to Education, nearly one-fifth of the record $40.3 billion raised by U.S. colleges and universities that year went to just 10 schools. Alumni and other individuals were the largest source of gifts, accounting for nearly 47% of the total. Through the tax deductions these donors claimed, taxpayers covered roughly $7.5 billion of the total donations. (That’s the amount donors would have had to pay into the federal treasury, were it not for the deductions.) None of this is to suggest that the philanthropic donations of Griffin or any other American plutocrats aren’t sincere and heartfelt. Among Griffin’s beneficiaries are the Obama Foundation, programs to bring internet access to low-income pupils, museums and COVID research programs.

But if everything were made permanent, as Democrats intended, the cost would be $4.6 trillion over 10 years, according to an estimate by the Penn Wharton Budget Model. Don't even consider Medicare for All, which analysts have pegged at something like $33 trillion over a decade. What about paying down the national debt, which West Virginia Sen.

Nora Loreto is a Canadian freelance writer and co-host of the podcast ""Sandy and Nora Talk Politics."" When Canada's Liberal government announced the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) on March 25, it was the early days of the pandemic. That month, Canada lost more than 1 million jobs, and no one knew when, or if, those jobs were coming back. The $500-per-week CERB became a lifeline to more than 8 million Canadians. (All figures in this article are in Canadian dollars; 500 Canadian dollars is equivalent to $382 in U.S. money.) Most people whose income dropped below $2,000 per month and who made at least $5,000 in 2019 are eligible for the benefit.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

In August, Leah Gazan, a member of Parliament from the New Democratic Party, served a motion for the government to create a guaranteed livable basic income based on the CERB. This sparked a new round of debates in Canada about whether a universal income should be a new social program. In a period where wealth inequality has grown increasingly obvious, and as the pandemic has knocked the economy on its head, it's no surprise that so many would look to a basic income as a solution. The problem is that a basic income cannot fix income inequality if it doesn't address the underlying costs that drive poverty.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

CERB alone risks reaching $100 billion if extended to 2021 — and it's not universal. Canadians who made less than $5,000 in 2019 were left out of the relief plan, and so, too, was everyone making more than $2,000 per month but who still live in poverty. With average rent in Toronto for a one-bedroom apartment at $2,300, a benefit of $2,000 per month doesn't go very far. As a comparison, health-care spending from all levels of government — provincial, territorial and federal — is just under $185 billion. A modest guaranteed income would likely cost more than all public health services spending combined.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-09-02	The Washington Post (Online)	Universal basic income in Canada won’t do enough to fix inequality	txt-opeds/2439516045.xml.txt	Advocates argue that the money to fund any universal program must come from increased taxation, and that the combination of the two would be an important mechanism to rebalance wealth in Canada. Gazan's colleague, NDP MP Peter Julian, served a motion this summer to create a new wealth tax, which would result in about $5.6 billion in new revenue for the federal government. During the 2019 election, the NDP also promised to increase corporate tax rates and go after money hidden in tax havens, measures that were estimated to generate $12.1 billion in the first year. While these policies will help mitigate some of Canada's income inequality, they don't go far enough. Nor would they bring in enough revenue to fund a UBI while maintaining current levels of social services spending.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE
2020-09-02	The Washington Post (Online)	Universal basic income in Canada won’t do enough to fix inequality	txt-opeds/2439516045.xml.txt	Income inequality in Canada was relatively stable in the post-World War II period but started to increase in the mid-1990s. At the same time, the Liberal government cut more than $18 billion in programs spending. Inequality peaked in 2006, where the top 1 percent of wealthiest Canadians represented 13.6 percent of market share. By 2017, it had fallen slightly to 11.3 percent. Income inequality is also deeply racialized, with White Canadians far more likely to be wealthy. To effectively target these inequalities, society has to first ensure that public services are in place to sustainably meet people's needs. Every Canadian is estimated to spend just over $1,000 annually on private drug costs and premiums. If these costs rise, a guaranteed income starts to evaporate. A national Pharmacare program, estimated to cost $15 billion, would eliminate these costs. Similarly, a national child-care program would make a big difference for families who pay $10,000 per child, per year on average. The same goes for elder care, as researchers Michel Grignon and Nicole F. Bernier estimate that each Canadian must save $7,500 per year for 40 years to be able to pay for expensive care in the final years of their lives.	4	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Without market controls to keep these costs low, a basic income would be little more than a transfer of wealth from the public purse to private hands through an individual's monthly stipend. This is the critical problem with a universal basic income: It has become a silver-bullet solution to all of the problems that austerity and neoliberalism have created, but it would not address any core problems. The CERB makes good sense during the pandemic and should continue as long as we live with covid-19. But what we need far more than an annual basic income are free and accessible public services such as child care, health care, transit, elder care and higher education, paid for through increased taxes on Canada's most wealthy.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Instead, we went from growth and a balanced budget to a dot-com crash, the 9/11 attacks followed by costly wars in the Middle East, a financial crisis, a global refugee crisis and the rise of populism across continents. ""Tear down that wall"" became ""Build the wall.""

This new tax is being levied on consumers and businesses in the form of tariffs, boycotts, restrictions on immigration, legacy deficits for our children and a careening back-and-forth between ideological extremes. How much will polarization cost us? It is impossible to say. But it is clear that our ability to solve our most pressing problems has ground to a near-halt. We see it while sweating in a stalled New York City subway car as the Chinese build world-class bullet trains. We see it as we tally the mounting costs of maintaining a public education system that lags those of competitor nations.

When walls are being erected, nations pay a tax: the crackdown on immigration in the United States has led to major labor shortages at construction firms, health-care providers and agricultural businesses. The trade war is driving up costs and reducing overseas market share for dairy farmers, car companies, electronics manufacturers and chip makers, to name just a few. Polarization has changed the game for companies seeking to connect with consumers, who today expect businesses to take stands on issues. Successful companies get beyond bemoaning the cost of this; they accept it and execute new strategies. Nike waded into a hot-button issue and embraced NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick to engender goodwill among a dedicated segment of customers. The shoemaker concluded that taking no position and playing to the center was not a viable long-term strategy. On the other end of the spectrum, Chick-fil-A has continued embracing conservative values even as boycotts and bad press persist.

The back-and-forth makes it difficult for anyone to plan ahead. As we begin the third decade of the 21st century, the polarization tax is making it more difficult and expensive to run companies and more challenging for citizens to reach political consensus.

How the Hidden Rules of Ownership Control Our Lives."" Heller is a professor at Columbia Law School. Salzman is a professor at UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science & Management and at UCLA Law School. Over the past pandemic year, American billionaires have grown $1.3 trillion richer, the beneficiaries of a soaring stock market. Income inequality has widened. One response is imposing new taxes on wealth, such as those just introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), but that approach faces significant political hurdles. There's another way to tackle the problem. Instead of focusing only on taxing wealth accumulation, we can address the hidden flip side — wealth transmission. America's super-rich have created a little-known parallel legal system in some unlikely states. There, they pass on massive amounts of wealth tax-free and lock in inequality for generations, exploiting cracks in our system of taxing inherited wealth.	0	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

The place to start is South Dakota, which has quietly made itself the world's leading money haven, crushing former go-to shelters such as Switzerland and the Cayman Islands. In theory, the super-wealthy pay some taxes when they pass on estates beyond the current tax-free exemption level of $11.7 million for an individual, $23.4 million per couple. But the reality is that the wealthy find legal ways to shelter their enormous estates using tax avoidance tools that understate their assets' true values. Often, they avoid any state or federal taxation whatsoever.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

In total, these estates will pay perhaps $16 billion — roughly a 2 percent average tax rate on America's inherited income, one-seventh the average tax rate on income from work and savings. How is this possible? Enter South Dakota. The state has created a bespoke legal system for America's richest families, with wealth-sheltering tools including the aptly named ""dynasty trust."" In 1983, the state adopted a 19-word law that effectively abolished the ""rule against perpetuities,"" an ancient, obscure rule that had one salutary effect: It kept families from locking up wealth perpetually. After the repeal, wealth advisers began advertising South Dakota as the go-to solution for aristocrat wannabes.	2	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

The giveaways work. Hundreds of billions in free-floating wealth have drained into the state.

Only the family wealth advisers who propose the rules. The trusts pay no state income, capital gains or inheritance taxes in South Dakota. Almost no roads get built, no  schools funded. South Dakota gets no tourism or investment bump. The rich don't even visit to sign papers. America's ultra-wealthy have pulled off a brilliantly designed heist, with a string of South Dakota governors as accomplices.

And by hyper-concentrating wealth, South Dakota locks away resources that could spark entrepreneurial innovation. All this is possible because, in the United States, states mostly define family ownership, not the federal government. Effectively, South Dakota is setting national policy. But Congress can override these choices and plug holes in our leaky estate tax system. One step would be to tax trusts at the passage of each generation and limit generation-skipping tax-exempt trusts. A bigger step would be to ensure that appreciated stocks — a big driver of wealth inequality — are taxed at least once.

They also demonstrated what could pull them apart. The Florida Republican spoke about how American capitalism had run aground and how a different understanding of the role of business and markets could save us from drowning. He argued that business had forgotten its obligation to society, describing in detail the disintegration of families and hollowing of communities. Noting the right of workers to share in the benefits they create for their employers, he proposed taxes on stock buybacks, an expanded federal child tax credit, paid parental leave and even a national cooperative bank for domestic investment.

Even Republicans realize that the market has ceased to serve the people, that the people have grown to resent it. And that unless business and its GOP allies find a better way, the people will instead. Into this breach, Rubio now calls for an economy in which ""workers and businesses are not competitors for their share of limited resources, but instead partners in an effort that benefits both."" Rubio is on to something here. Both Democrats and Republicans have grown skeptical of an economic system in which the financial sector's share of corporate profits has increased from 10 percent to nearly 30 percent over the past four decades at the expense of the average worker. Proud socialists would like to be able to support their families by earning an honest wage, while even self-avowed capitalists would prefer their jobs not be offshored under the guise of ""market efficiency.""

Scattered throughout his remarks were tired references to the ""outrage police"" and an easily ""triggered"" left, and coastal-living ""political elites"" who ""incessantly mock"" Middle America's traditional values. He even claimed that he might be hounded by the ""blue check brigade"" for what he was about to say (News flash, Marco Rubio: You have a blue check on Twitter — and on Instagram, and on Facebook.

Despite the fact that many of its disciples agree wholeheartedly with his economic critiques, the left was derided as ""an enthusiastic champion of everyone's right to free everything,"" whose members ""rarely focus on our obligation to work."" He described the ideas proposed by Warren and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) — which are gaining increasing traction across the country — as un-American and doomed to fail. ""We have millions of refugees who came here fleeing socialism who can be witnesses"" to that, neglecting to clarify that Medicare-for-all or a wealth tax were not why people fled the Soviet Union or are hiding from Venezuela's special police force.

""Rich families and corporations should pay a lot more in taxes than they do today, and middle-class families should pay less.""

People of every political persuasion give President Trump negative marks on his handling of health care and poverty. When asked what they believed is the most important issue that Trump and Congress should address in the coming year, ""making health care more affordable"" was cited by a majority of voters. Only a third of the entire electorate supported cutting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in an effort to address the national debt.

Talk about the middle class, and threats to it from wealthy interests. Voters who are concerned about electability should pay attention to what the candidates are actually saying, making note of who is making these kinds of arguments.

2019-11-05	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s plan to finance Medicare-for-all pushes into dangerous and uncharted territory	txt-opeds/2312443006.xml.txt	Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren  last week mounted a passionate defense of universal government-provided health care and made a detailed case that it can be paid for without burdening the middle class. The vision of Medicare-for-all is immensely attractive and evokes health systems in other countries that perform much better than ours does. I could easily imagine supporting a well-designed Medicare-for-all plan. However, no other country offers as broad coverage as Medicare-for-all would or claims to provide universal health insurance without taxing its middle class. With respect to the admirably detailed plan the Massachusetts senator laid out, there will, I suspect, be serious questions about the accuracy of her arithmetic, the impact on labor markets, the feasibility of applying Warren's full set of proposed taxes to the rich, and the financial and economic impacts of the plan.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-11-05	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s plan to finance Medicare-for-all pushes into dangerous and uncharted territory	txt-opeds/2312443006.xml.txt	Campaign arithmetic is always optimistic, but errors are highly consequential with respect to a program that on some measures is eight times as large as the Trump tax cut. Warren estimates the revenue potential of increased Internal Revenue Service enforcement as being about 65 times as large as the Congressional Budget Office's enforcement proposal. The University of Pennsylvania's Natasha Sarin and I have been working to make the case that the CBO is far too pessimistic in its estimates of the potential for better enforcement to generate revenue. But the most optimistic scenario we can envision is still more than $1 trillion short of the Warren estimate.	1	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-05	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s plan to finance Medicare-for-all pushes into dangerous and uncharted territory	txt-opeds/2312443006.xml.txt	Further, Warren's plan would double the 3 percent tax on wealth over $1 billion that she has already proposed. Many experts believe the Warren wealth-tax revenue estimates are too high, perhaps by a factor of two, because they overestimate the wealth of the very rich and, as Sarin and I have argued, underestimate potential avoidance. Whatever the merits of these arguments, it is hard to see a defense for assuming — as the Warren proposal does — that wealth taxes can be doubled with no impact on avoidance, or that annual capital gains taxes can be levied without reducing the wealth tax base. The estimates are also infected by erroneous transcription of the CBO's 10-year growth estimates and by a general failure to take account of interactions between the different tax measures proposed.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-11-05	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s plan to finance Medicare-for-all pushes into dangerous and uncharted territory	txt-opeds/2312443006.xml.txt	Second, there will be large labor market effects: Warren's plan will discourage hiring, particularly of low-skilled workers, by firms that currently provide generous benefits. These firms will face the most burdensome taxes when they increase hiring and will gain the greatest cost savings by laying off workers. In addition, workers' incentives to take jobs will be dulled because they will no longer be compensated with health benefits (which will become available regardless of what they do). There are further potential economic perversities as well: To cut costs, firms will be incentivized to get below the 50-employee threshold and scale back on current health benefits. And all the efforts that employers have engaged in to contain costs and to encourage prevention will become pointless.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-11-05	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s plan to finance Medicare-for-all pushes into dangerous and uncharted territory	txt-opeds/2312443006.xml.txt	Third, the combined tax impact of Warren's various plans is extreme. While the case for more tax progressivity is compelling, and each of the Warren measures can be defended in isolation, there is the concern that their cumulative impact may be excessive should, as the Warren campaign repeatedly claims, they be borne only by the very wealthy. Here is a suggestive comparison: The total after-tax adjusted gross income of all those earning more than $1 million or more, as last reported by the IRS in its Statistics of Income publication, was under $1.1 trillion. The sum of all the new taxes on the wealthy proposed by Warren is of comparable magnitude: adding together around $310 billion a year in new wealth taxes; $330 billion a year in corporate taxes from her new proposals and her previous real corporate profits taxes; $240 billion a year from her new capital gains and finance tax proposals; at least $90 billion from her across-the-board 14.8 percent taxes of labor and investment income; and $190 billion in increased compliance. This totals nearly $1.2 trillion — more than millionaires' total after-tax income.	4	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2019-11-05	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s plan to finance Medicare-for-all pushes into dangerous and uncharted territory	txt-opeds/2312443006.xml.txt	Of course, this calculation is an oversimplification. Different taxpayers are situated differently and will be affected differently by any set of proposals. There will be tax collections from those who are not middle class but still earn less than $1 million a year. There are sources of ""income"" that will be taxed under the Medicare-for-all proposal that do not show up in current adjusted gross income — unrealized capital gains or corporate retained earnings, for example. On the other hand, it's highly problematic given the avoidance and other bad incentives likely to result, to be anywhere in the ballpark of confiscatory taxation of high-income taxpayers.	5	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-11-05	The Washington Post (Online)	Warren’s plan to finance Medicare-for-all pushes into dangerous and uncharted territory	txt-opeds/2312443006.xml.txt	Finally, what of the economic and financial effects of Warren's proposals? A place to start is by thinking about the potential impact on the stock market. The market is valued as investors' claim on future corporate earnings, which the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates are about $1.8 trillion this year. As a result of all the tax claims just described, the Warren program would reduce investors' claim on these earnings. Recognizing that some of these taxes fall on salary income or non-corporate business, it is reasonable to estimate that investors will pay an extra $500 billion to $600 billion in taxes related to corporate profits. Then, Medicare-for-all proponents cite a severe hit to health industry profits, currently on track to be over $200 billion this year. Then, there will be the broader impacts of overhauling regulation, often to serve vital social interests, in initiatives such as banning fracking and reforming the energy industry, stepping up financial regulation, a major increase in antitrust enforcement and the regulation of technology companies, and filling corporate board seats with labor representatives. It is hard to see an argument that investors' claim on profits would fall less than a third. The figure could be considerably greater.	6	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Accurate market predictions are impossible and will in any event depend not on what is proposed but on what the market expects will actually take place. There is, however, the real risk of economic contraction following a sharp market decline, especially given that the current very low level of interest rates puts the Fed in a weak position to pursue counter-cyclical policy. For decades, I have emphasized that corporate profits and the market do better when progressives are in power and have dismissed conservative fear-mongering about progressive policies.	7	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

If cable-news coverage matched reality, you would expect voters to think the most important issue out there is the Russia investigation, and that their questions would reflect it. That is not the case, really in any campaign. Voters ask about issues, not scandals. If cable-news coverage matched reality, former representative Beto O'Rourke (Tex.) and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) would be leading the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. The latest Morning Consult poll tell us that, among all primary voters, former vice president Joe Biden (35 percent) maintains a big lead; Sanders is second at 25 percent; and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), O'Rourke and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) are bunched behind Sanders at 8 percent, 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively. If you believed the coverage of her management techniques, you might think Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) was kaput.

If coverage matched not only these numbers but crowd size, the narrative of the race would go like this: Biden, who has yet to officially enter the race, remains the clear favorite despite all the talk about the energy on the left wing of the party.

Rather than obsess on her ""likability"" (voters like her so far just about as much as they like Harris and O'Rourke), they might cover what she says and start pressing other candidates for more specifics. Of all the candidates, Harris has moved the most dramatically and held her place as a top-tier candidate. Her crowds number in the thousands. On a personal level, she is the warmest and most emotionally present when interacting with voters. Of all the candidates, she looks like she is having the most fun.

O'Rourke got a ton of media coverage and raised a boatload of money. In regards to polling, he's about where he was before he entered the race.

As it happens, Edwards is marginally more charitable toward the IRS than Pino.

The Post's Editorial Board observes that ""there are the potential economic consequences of the taxes Ms. Warren proposes to raise to meet her fantasy $20.5 trillion price tag. Former treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers warns that Ms. Warren would so clobber upper-income Americans that she would risk a stock market crash and a recession."" She suffered an embarrassing blow when economist Mark Zandi who signed off on Warren's math calculations came out against her plan. He said, ""I'm skeptical the wealth tax will generate the same amount of revenue after considering all her plans together. . . . I am not a fan of Medicare for All. We have 160 million people who have private insurance and are pretty happy with what they have. Why change that?"" Yikes.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

We spend an awful lot already on health care, he says about $52 trillion over the next decade, ""currently split among the federal government, the states and the private sector, with the federal government making up only about 29 percent of the total."" Rattner explains nearly all of that plus about $7 trillion more to cover all Americans would shift to the feds under Warren's plan. Rattner makes a point few others have identified: ""Warren's plans (mostly health care, but including education and other proposals) would change that historic relationship dramatically. New taxes and other revenues that would be imposed would increase Washington's share of the economy to around 27 percent, a more than 50 percent increase from current levels."" It would behoove Warren and her supporters to consider how that may affect growth, job creation, wages and a host of other critical economic factors.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-11-08	The Washington Post (Online)	Elizabeth Warren misses the biggest cost of all	txt-opeds/2312997384.xml.txt	Rattner, as others, also finds fault with the math. He counts up the $12.6 trillion in new corporate taxes; $4.4 trillion of added taxes on wealthy Americans; a $800B military spending cut; and ""savings"" from immigration reform. Rattner finds: ""That leaves $15.9 trillion, which includes a variety of the gimmicks that many other public officials have used futilely to try to make their budget math work, like tougher Internal Revenue Service tax enforcement."" Rattner is being generous since there is every reason to doubt that a President Warren would get the military cuts or comprehensive immigration reform. It is even more far-fetched to think the rich won't evade a good chunk of the $4.4 trillion in wealth taxes.	2	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE

Instead of selling and, if elected, trying to enact an unattainable plan, she could be building consensus and then fighting to enact much needed, attainable and significant reforms. Rattner points out, ""We can improve the Affordable Care Act. Spending on infrastructure and research and development — two critical government functions — should be increased."" Warren, however, will be out panning for gold, chasing after riches (from a tiny segment of the population, whom we better hope doesn't lose money or give it away and leave health care without a funding source) and dreaming up elaborate scheme when winnable fights are delayed.

Instead of losing a Medicare-for-all fight, she could be winning on extending Medicaid to the remaining states and passing a workable drug-cost-control measure.

2018-11-01	New York Times (Online)	‘I Like Your Photographs Because They Are Beautiful’	txt-opeds/2127559726.xml.txt	Ara Guler, who died on Oct. 17, was the greatest photographer of modern Istanbul. He was born in 1928 in an Armenian family in Istanbul. Ara began taking photographs of the city in 1950, images that captured the lives of individuals alongside the city’s monumental Ottoman architecture, its majestic mosques and magnificent fountains. I was born two years later, in 1952, and lived in the same neighborhoods he lived in. Ara Guler’s Istanbul is my Istanbul. I first heard of Ara in the 1960s when I saw his photographs in Hayat, a widely read weekly news and gossip magazine with a strong emphasis on photography. One of my uncles edited it. Ara published portraits of writers and artists such as Picasso and Dali, and the celebrated literary and cultural figures of an older generation in Turkey such as the novelist Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar. When Ara photographed me for the first time after the success of my novel “The Black Book,” I realized happily that I had arrived as a writer.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2018-11-01	New York Times (Online)	‘I Like Your Photographs Because They Are Beautiful’	txt-opeds/2127559726.xml.txt	Ara devotedly photographed Istanbul for over half a century, continuing into the 2000s. I eagerly studied his photographs, to see in them the development and transformation of the city itself. My friendship with Ara began in 2003, when I was consulting his archive of 900,000 photographs to research my book “Istanbul.” He had turned the large three-story home he inherited from his father, a pharmacist from the Galatasaray neighborhood in the Beyoglu district of the city, into a workshop, office and archive. The photographs I wanted for my book were not those famous Ara Guler shots everyone knew but images more attuned to the melancholy Istanbul I was describing, the grayscale atmosphere of my childhood. Ara had many more of such photographs than I expected. He detested images of a sterile, sanitized, touristic Istanbul. Having discovered where my interests lay, he gave me access to his archives undisturbed.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2018-11-01	New York Times (Online)	‘I Like Your Photographs Because They Are Beautiful’	txt-opeds/2127559726.xml.txt	It was through Ara’s urban reportage photography, which appeared in newspapers in the early 1950s, his portraits of the poor, the unemployed and the new arrivals from the countryside, that I first saw the “unknown” Istanbul. Ara’s attentiveness to the inhabitants of Istanbul’s back streets — the fishermen sitting in coffee shops and mending their nets, the unemployed men getting inebriated in taverns, the children patching up car tires in the shadow of the city’s crumbling ancient walls, the construction crews, the railway workers, the boatmen pulling at their oars to ferry city folk from one shore of the Golden Horn to the other, the fruit sellers pushing their handcarts, the people milling about at dawn waiting for the Galata Bridge to open, the early-morning minibus drivers — is evidence of how he always expressed his attachment to the city through the people who live in it.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

His photographs also made me discover how much more fragile and poor the people of Istanbul appeared when captured alongside the city’s monumental Ottoman architecture, its majestic mosques and magnificent fountains. “You only like my photographs because they remind you of the Istanbul of your childhood,” he would at times say to me, sounding oddly irritated. “No!” I would protest. “I like your photographs because they are beautiful.”	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

Are things not beautiful because they are slightly familiar and resemble our memories? I enjoyed discussing such questions with him. While working in his archive of Istanbul photographs, I often wondered what it was about them that so profoundly appealed to me. Would the same images appeal to others? There is something dizzying about looking at the images of the neglected and yet still lively details of the city I have spent my life in — the cars and the hawkers on its streets, the traffic policemen, the workers, the women in head scarves crossing bridges enveloped in fog, the old bus stops, the shadows of its trees, the graffiti on its walls.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

A street might remind us of the sting of getting fired from a job; the sight of a particular bridge might bring back the loneliness of our youth. A city square might recall the bliss of a love affair; a dark alleyway might be a reminder of our political fears; an old coffeehouse might evoke the memory of our friends who have been jailed.

I sensed that it would be difficult to speak about this harrowing subject with him, that it would put a strain on our relationship. He knew that speaking about it would make it harder for him to survive in Turkey. Over the years, he trusted me a little and occasionally brought up political subjects he wouldn’t raise with others. One day he told me that in 1942, to avoid the exorbitant “Wealth Tax” the Turkish government was imposing specifically on its non-Muslim citizens, and to evade deportation to a forced labor camp on failing to pay the tax, his pharmacist father had left his home in Galatasaray and hidden for months in a different house, never once venturing outside.	6	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

Armenian and Greek families ran most of the stores on Istiklal Avenue. In the 1950s I would visit their shops with my mother. They spoke Turkish with an accent. When my mother and I would return home, I used to imitate their accented Turkish. After the ethnic cleansing of 1955, the purpose of which was to intimidate and exile the city’s non-Muslim minorities, most of them left Istiklal Avenue and their homes in Istanbul.

Yet we still did not touch upon the destruction of the Ottoman Armenians, Ara’s grandfathers and grandmothers. In 2005, I gave an interview where I complained that there was no freedom of thought in Turkey and we still couldn’t talk about the terrible things that were done to the Ottoman Armenians 90 years ago.

Because of the death threats I was receiving, the charges that had been brought against me and the vicious campaign in the nationalist press, I started spending more time abroad, in New York. I would return to my office in Istanbul for brief stays, without telling anyone I was back. On one of those brief visits home from New York, during some of the darkest days after Hrant Dink’s assassination, I walked into my office and the phone immediately started ringing. In those days I never picked up my office phone. The ringing would pause occasionally, but then it would start again, on and on. Uneasy, I eventually picked up. Straight away, I recognized Ara’s voice. “Oh, you’re back! I am coming over now,” he said, and hung up without waiting for my response.	9	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

He kept on swearing and telling me, “They can’t touch you, those people!” His tears weren’t slowing down. The more he cried, the more I was gripped by a strange sense of guilt and felt paralyzed.

The great photographer had already told me everything through his tears. Ara had hoped for a democracy where individuals could speak freely of their murdered ancestors, or at least freely weep for them. Turkey never became that democracy. The success of the past 15 years, a period of economic growth built on borrowed money, has been used not to broaden the reach of democracy but to restrict freedom of thought even further.

""The confidential tax records obtained by ProPublica,"" claims the nonprofit investigative reporting outfit, ""show that the ultrarich effectively sidestep this system"" (emphasis added). Understand: ""This system,"" in ProPublica's usage, means our income tax system; by ""sidestepping,"" it means legally complying with the code.

Let's understand: If ProPublica wanted to propose a wealth tax, it could. Few subjects have been more researched, debated and theorized over than optimal capital taxation. But that's not what ProPublica does. Over and over it uses words like ""avoid"" and ""avoiding"" for Americans not paying a nonexistent tax. By ProPublica's reasoning, anybody is a tax avoider who engages in an untaxed activity. If you walk down the street, you are avoiding the federal walking tax.	1	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE

In my 40 years as an adult, I've only heard politicians decry the tax code. Jimmy Carter said it was a disgrace to the human race. Joe Biden, speaking to Congress in April, spent more words on its alleged unfairness than on any other subject. We in journalism publish many claims that, even when the facts are accurate, are stupid. But I doubt reporters Jesse Eisinger, Jeff Ernsthausen and Paul Kiel are so stupid they don't know how labored and disingenuous their justifications are.

All you do is troll the documents for the names of famous rich people. Throw in some words stating a ""news judgment"" claim, however nonsensical, that the resulting journalism is of extraordinary public value. And yet you can be sure, in the unlikely event that ProPublica found itself in front of a judge, it would retreat to the claim that the tax payments of the wealthy are newsworthy, period.

Audits is a key word. The IRS is a law-enforcement agency. Taxpayers submit their returns to be vetted by an agency empowered to pursue civil and criminal charges. The only crime uncovered in ProPublica's reporting is the one ProPublica itself participated in, illegally trafficking in these returns. ProPublica says it doesn't know who stole the data—it might be a foreign intelligence agency. But this is only part of what ProPublica doesn't know. It doesn't know if its stash constitutes an entirety of the stolen records. It doesn't know who else might in be in possession of the stolen data.

Which brings me to a question. Why haven't we heard from the IRS? If these are IRS records (and it's hard to imagine how they could be anything else), doesn't the agency owe thousands of individual taxpayers a warning that their confidential data have been released into the wild?

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) had an exchange that tells you almost everything you need to know about the Warren campaign, and even the broader Democratic contest. It happened when moderator Andrea Mitchell lobbed her a softball question about uniting the country, and Warren batted it away with a paean to her favorite policy: stiff wealth taxation. ""The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together,"" said Warren, ""is we talk about the things that unite us, and that is that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks.""

What's somewhat more interesting is their respective constituencies. Booker is overperforming among nonwhite voters, who tend to be not just lower-income but more socially conservative, and more focused on bread-and-butter issues, than white Democrats. Warren, on the other hand, is the candidate of the affluent, the educated and the white, what Republican polling firm Echelon Insights recently dubbed the ""Acela Party."" It might seem a bit strange that wealth taxes are being promulgated by a candidate who caters to white professionals with healthy household balance sheets, while the former mayor of Newark is making such investment-bankerly noises. But in fact there's a certain logic to it. After all, wealth taxes — as Booker ably pointed out — don't really make much sense as a technocratic policy matter.	2	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

That money doesn't necessarily go to anyone else, mind you; it may just get eaten up by compliance costs and dead-weight losses. But the rich people definitely won't have it. This is a fairly useless policy goal unless you happen to be in direct competition with wealthy people for social status and scarce resources such as elite school places. The best way to understand a wealth tax, in other words, is not in terms of rich and poor but as an intra-elite battle. The two sides are characterized by what New York Times columnist David Brooks once dubbed ""status-income disequilibrium."" One side consists of people whose elite jobs are well-paid compared with the national average but poorly paid compared with similarly educated and successful people in more mercenary fields, and who can therefore generally only access the best resources by leveraging family money, professional prestige or social capital. On the other side are those with more lucrative occupations who crassly buy their way in.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Better still, this sounds like it does something for the poor, allowing them, and Warren, to congratulate themselves that they're really a finer grade of person, rather than some self-interested boob who votes from the pocketbook. It's a startlingly apt summation of so much of Warren's campaign: policies that sound like they help the poor while somehow delivering the greatest benefits to the educated elites of the Acela Corridor.

2019-03-10	New York Times (Online)	The Democratic Candidates Should Tell Us Now Who They’ll Put on the Supreme Court	txt-opeds/2189341407.xml.txt	How did our legal landscape become this anti-defendant? In part because so many federal judges are former prosecutors. Ms. Barkow reports that 43 percent of federal judges have been prosecutors, while 10 percent have been public defenders. A judge’s career background doesn’t always predict her rulings — Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a former prosecutor, often stands up for the accused. But she is the exception. Federal judicial opinions typically read as if their authors have given little thought to how an excessively punitive criminal justice system can ruin lives, decimate families and lay waste to entire communities. To upend this dynamic, Democratic presidential candidates must commit themselves to appointing federal judges who will work to challenge mass incarceration. This will mean going beyond anything President Barack Obama attempted. When Mr. Obama wrote a 55-page law review article on what a president could do to push criminal justice reform, he made no mention of judicial appointments. Worse, his appointments displayed almost the same pro-prosecution bias as his predecessors’: About 40 percent of his judicial nominees had worked as prosecutors, while some 15 percent had been public defenders.	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2019-03-10	New York Times (Online)	The Democratic Candidates Should Tell Us Now Who They’ll Put on the Supreme Court	txt-opeds/2189341407.xml.txt	Democratic candidates should promise to eliminate this bias by reshaping the federal bench so that it has as many former public defenders as it does former prosecutors. The Supreme Court is a good place to start. Remember when Donald Trump courted the conservative right by announcing the names of possible nominees  several months before the 2016 election? Any Democratic candidate who wants to win the votes of a Democratic electorate increasingly focused on criminal justice reform should make a similar announcement — and populate the list with lawyers who have seen the criminal system from the standpoint of the accused.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

High on my list would be Bryan Stevenson, a career death penalty opponent, consummate Supreme Court litigator and founder of the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama. Or Michelle Alexander, former law clerk for Justice Harry Blackmun, civil rights lawyer and author of the canonical “The New Jim Crow.” (Ms. Alexander is also an opinion columnist for The New York Times.) Or Sherrilyn Ifill, a voting rights expert and head of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, the civil rights firm founded by Thurgood Marshall in 1940. These aren’t the names that typically appear on Democratic short lists. They aren’t sitting judges, and unlike many who now serve on the federal bench, they’ve taken unpopular stands, sometimes at great risk. As a result, my list might sound unconventional, even outlandish, to those accustomed to the traditional approach to judicial selection. But it shouldn’t. With impeccable credentials, unassailable legal acumen and a fierce determination to take down mass incarceration, these are the future nominees whose names should start rolling off the tongues of Democratic candidates who want to be taken seriously as criminal justice reformers.	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Harris released a health-care plan Monday that reshapes her stance on the sharply divisive issue, proposing a government-run system that would allow private insurance as long as it follows Medicare's coverage rules. The plan is in many ways a middle ground between Sen. Bernie Sanders's Medicare-for-all proposal and former vice president Joe Biden's desire to build on the current system. ... Harris had previously said private insurance should continue to exist only to cover supplemental medical expenses, such as cosmetic surgery, foreign travel insurance and other services not covered by Medicare. But on Monday she said she would allow a variation of Medicare Advantage plans, private policies that offer the same services as Medicare but often use a provider network. Harris also wants to expand Medicare coverage to include vision and dental care, as well as hearing aids and mental health services.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The Post notes, ""Harris told reporters she'd heard three main concerns about Medicare-for-all on the campaign trail: that it was too big to implement quickly; that it would require middle-class tax increases; and that 'people don't want government or anyone to take away their choices.' "" She sounds an awful lot like Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Biden (who have resisted even the term ""Medicare-for-all""), not to mention savvy center-left pundits warning candidates not to adopt an ideologically pristine and politically risky plan that lacks a good policy rationale.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

She finances the plan not with a wealth tax (like Warren's heavily criticized plan) but with a tax on financial transactions. Umm, that's a better, more realistic option, isn't it? Harris's rivals are going ballistic, accusing her of trying to be all things to all people. They might not mean it as such, but that's called good politics. Getting the best of both worlds — rallying the base without losing the center (or giving a pathway to Medicare without scaring people) — is exactly how one wins elections, even primary elections in which the party is properly concerned about giving President Trump ammunition to unload on the eventual nominee. Sanders's campaign put out a blatantly misleading statement accusing Harris of trying to ""privatize"" Medicare. Lily Adams, Harris's communications director, tells me, ""It's just not true and frankly they know it. Her plan immediately expands coverage, is most closely modeled after the current Medicare system that works and is the best way to get to universal coverage and take on big insurance companies.""	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

In Harris's case, she avoids the pitfalls of Sanders's plan without giving up on improved access. ""Senator Harris's plan is an effort to balance idealism and pragmatism. It says in effect: We have a mandate to get everyone affordable health care and put people over profits — but we don't need to tear down the things people have and they like in order to do it.""	3	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

If Democrats become advocates for destroying the entire system and creating chaos and ""socialism,"" then Democrats will wind up handing Trump the advantage. Harris has used her telegenic personality, prosecutorial flair and precise policy positioning (left, but not too far left) to balance three competing concerns: Rally the critical African American base, endear herself to the progressive wing of the party and preserve her general-election credibility — without which Democrats desperate for a win are unlikely to nominate her.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

2019-02-03	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders’s estate tax plan would reduce the federal debt and help even the playing field	txt-opeds/2175219282.xml.txt	IT WILL not be a question of whether prominent 2020 Democratic presidential candidates favor hiking taxes on the very wealthy. It will be a question of how they propose to do it. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) last month suggested a wealth tax of 2 percent per year on fortunes of more than $50 million, an idea that is constitutionally questionable and logistically difficult. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) entered the scene Thursday with a better plan: substantially hiking the estate tax on huge inheritances, an alternative to taxing someone's fortune during his or her lifetime. The country has an estate tax, but the rate and the amount exempted from the inheritance tax have bounced around as Republicans and Democrats have fought a tug of war over its terms. The number of estates hit with some level of inheritance tax has plummeted from more than 50,000 in 2001 to fewer than 10,000 in recent years. The 2017 GOP tax law doubled the inheritance tax exemption from $11 million per couple to $22 million per couple, driving the number of estates liable to pay the tax below a negligible 2,000 per year.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities pointed out that, even for those heirs getting more than $22 million, the latest estate tax reform amounted to giving them a $4.4 million tax break on the newly exempted portion of their inheritance. The price tag for the federal government is $83 billion over a decade — or, put another way, $83 billion in extra debt over a decade.	1	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

He would insist that estates worth more than $3.5 million pay at least 45 percent on money over that threshold, with higher tax brackets scaled to the size of the fortune in question. The rate would be 77 percent — the top rate from 1941 to 1976 — on estates worth more than $1 billion. Because such a plan would spur estate planners to seek legally creative ways to avoid inheritance taxes, Mr. Sanders would also close some loopholes currently used as tax avoidance vehicles.

Federal debt as a share of the economy has spiked. Rising generations face huge challenges paying for the health care and pensions of their retiring parents. Meanwhile, the very wealthiest Americans have done extremely well in recent decades, with a drift toward an ever-higher concentration of national wealth at the top. Weak inheritance taxes have contributed to this trend. Critics charge that the estate tax taxes income twice, first when it is earned and second when it is inherited. Yet it also serves as a backstop against avoidance of other types of taxation, in which the wealthy excel.	3	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

So one of the companies you worked for, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, you said that you were analyzing costs there, and after you completed that project, the company moved ahead with hundreds of layoffs and rate increases. [Blue Cross Blue Shield was Mr. Buttigieg’s first assignment at McKinsey. He worked there for three months in 2007.

BA: Another of your clients, Loblaws, the grocery chain, has since said that it was involved in the price fixing of bread during the time that you were analyzing grocery prices for them.

[In August, the Business Roundtable, a lobbying organization that represents many of the country’s largest companies, issued a statement redefining the purpose of a corporation.

When I was there, there was a lot of talk about values. Firm values. Now, a lot of that was around impact and making sure that you put the client’s interest first. There’s one story that they were proud of that I remember was part of our training.

But in the initial analysis, while they were doing their first round of work, the conclusion they reached was that this company shouldn’t go to China at all.

Now, if we had a benefit structure in this country that was not only portable but also prorated, then we would be able to remove some of the magic that creates an incentive to have people be contractors rather than employees, and some of the incentives to be a part-time employer versus a full-time employer as well, for people who are employees on the books.	17	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

But if it’s just a way to get around the obligations of having an employee, then I think it needs to be reassessed and the more that can be brought in house, the better.

First of all, the substance of what we have to offer. I’m really proud of what’s in the Douglass Plan. [Mr. Buttigieg’s Douglass Plan, named for the abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass, aims to reduce the country’s prison population by 50 percent, address maternal mortality in the black community and increase funding for historically black colleges and universities among many other aims.] It’s praised as the most comprehensive plan on dealing with systemic inequality put forward by a presidential candidate. Not, of course, because I sat in a room and thought up all these brilliant ideas, but because we had a lot of conversation and a lot of dialogue and fit our values to a plan to move forward. The more I communicate that plan, the better received it is and the better received I am.	26	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	But I also think before a lot of folks care what’s in your plan, they need to know what’s in your heart. And I’m working in not just traditional campaign formats — big speeches and TV appearances — but also we’ve been doing more and more quiet and smaller engagements. Our recent tour to the South, for example, had a lot of conversations that were between 20 and 50 people. Some of them very targeted around a policy issue like health equity or minority entrepreneurship. Some of it more about making sure that I was speaking to and hearing from folks who had been overlooked. So when we were in South Carolina, for example, we were with an almost all-black Democratic group in Allendale County. This is early presidential primary state, right? They hadn’t seen a presidential candidate in more than a decade, and you could feel the extent to which they felt overlooked. Those kinds of engagements I think are very important, too. It’s not just about obviously, our goal to win, it’s about deserving to win. I think that kind of dialogue coupled with all of the things that you do in traditional campaigning is really important right now.	27	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

For example, your policies on an inclusive economy say somewhat vaguely that you’re going to knock down unfair barriers to entrepreneurship. [A key feature of Mr. Buttigieg’s plan for an inclusive economy is his Walker-Lewis Initiative, which aims to triple the number of entrepreneurs from underrepresented communities in the next decade.] What would that look like? PB: Sure. So first of all, we know that there are challenges to access to credit. [Black families on average have one-tenth the wealth of white families; a key factor is that black, Hispanic and young people are more likely to be denied credit.] In fact, virtually every small African-American-owned business that I’ve visited in this campaign, I ask, how’d you get started? How’d you get your start-up money? They always say they had to come up with the cash. That’s a pattern of course that’s borne out on everything from how mom-and-pop businesses experience commercial banking to the well-documented fact of V.C. [venture capital] money, almost all going to a small handful of people and kinds of people in a certain number of places.	28	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	So there are things we can do about that. One thing we can do is capitalize CDFIs better — Community Development Financial Institutions — that have a much better track record of in turn supporting minority entrepreneurship. The way I would do it would be a 5X C.R.A. super credit for any of the larger institutions to flow funds into CDFIs. [Community Development Financial Institutions are private institutions created to provide financial services in underserved communities, particularly low-income people. They include Community Development Banks, Community Development Credit Unions, Community Development Loan Funds and Community Development Venture Capital Funds.] Another thing we can do is direct co-investment — this is part of our Walker-Lewis Initiative — in businesses led by those who are underrepresented. There’s precedent for this with TEDCO in Maryland, and I think that kind of co-investment could be very powerful. We’ve seen it in other countries — you actually see it in the Israeli start-up community with state-supported grants.	29	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

[Ms. Gay is referring to the Equal Justice Initiative’s Legacy Museum and National Memorial for Peace and Justice, sites dedicated to victims of white supremacy and especially lynching. Mr. Staples wrote an editorial observer on the museum and memorial here, and Mr. Wegman wrote one here.] PB: I have. Yeah. Very recently, and it is haunting because it evokes things that I’ve seen in places like Cambodia, and it’s on American soil. The way they’ve constructed it is, I think, it forces you to understand the relationship between past, present and future. That’s, of course, all the brilliant work that Bryan Stevenson and the Equal Justice Initiative are doing. The fact that it arose out of activism on the death penalty, for example, in Alabama, a state that does not offer counsel past trial and, I think, maybe first appeal for the indigent even on death row, shows you that this is not just about marking something that happened. [Mr. Stevenson, founder and executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, was inspired to push for the creation of the memorial by criminal justice reform work he was doing in Alabama. The museum has an exhibit about Anthony Ray Hinton, who was wrongfully convicted by an all-white jury and spent 28 years on death row.] This is about connecting all of the patterns of injustice and surfacing the violent nature of that injustice in a way that forces us to contend with how it’s all connected.	32	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

[This is included in Mr. Buttigieg’s Douglass Plan.] Anyway, it was a very powerful experience, and I think it’s very important for us to view not as an antiquarian kind of thing, but as a touchstone for what we’ve got to deal with right now. Aisha Harris: Mr. Mayor, you recently said that the failures of the old normal help explain how we got to Trump. Where does Obama fit into all of that? Because he was in office for eight years.

Health care was extended to millions of Americans. The auto industry was, was rescued in our country, is pretty good for eight years work. I also think that —— BS: That’s the other thing that — sorry to interrupt you. The other thing to that is the number of racist hate groups kind of quintupled under his leadership.

I mean this is surfacing things that — as in a different way, the arrival of the first African-American president surfaced things that — of course, had been here all along. We’re going to have to reckon with the extent to which Trump and Trumpism reflect a lot more about America than we might want to admit. Now, he was also, I think, capitalizing on a wave of populism that was responsive to what I would call a 40-year-long Reagan era that President Obama was the last Democratic president serving within. [It is widely argued that the 1970s ushered in a new era of neoliberalism, whose economic and social policies put capitalism and free market competition at its core.] In other words, he was constrained by an atmosphere, a neoliberal consensus, where even for Democrats, most of the time, the only thing you could ever say you were going to do to a tax was cut it.

Because in part, one of the issues that I think a lot of especially young people have is that you don’t seem nearly as progressive or as revolutionary in some ways as some of the other candidates. That’s something a lot of young people are looking for. So how do you — can you explain in a little bit more detail how you think about that? PB: Yeah. Sure. First of all, what I’m proposing would make me the most progressive president in the lifetimes, not only of young people, but I mean, certainly in the last half century. I’ll also say that it matters that we hold together an American majority that is progressive enough that it unlocks possibilities that were not available even 10 years ago during the Obama presidency. So it took everything that the Democratic Party had just to push through a health care reform in the A.C.A., invented by conservatives. Right?

Where we are right now is that there is a powerfully large, not everybody obviously, but a powerfully large American majority. Not only to do the right thing on areas where Democrats have generally been trusted — wages, labor, health — but also areas where we’ve been on defense, like immigration, guns. Holding that majority together is a big part of the task of the next president. I’m not just talking about how to win an election. I’m talking about how to govern this country. We need to have enough clarity of vision that we can see that the boldness of an idea is not measured only by how many people it can alienate, but by what it can get done. So there’s always a more extreme solution on offer that sometimes I’ll be competing with.

I’m talking about a game-changing transformation on the availability of funds to go to college. I’m talking about getting our climate carbon neutral by 2050. That will test the limits of human capacity, and there will always be some folks who say, it’s not real. Health care reform isn’t real unless you obliterate the entire private industry. College isn’t real unless even the child of a billionaire can go without paying a penny in tuition.

What do you see as real advantages or challenges as being the first openly gay candidate for a major party? [As recently as 2007, just 55 percent of voters said they would support a gay or lesbian candidate according to FiveThirtyEight.] BS: And I have a related question to that, kind of piggy back on it. You’ve talked about your decision not to come out over some period of your life, and I believe we recorded you in a story of saying at some point you thought that coming out would be a political death, a career death sentence. [You can Read “Pete Buttigieg’s Life in the Closet” by Jeremy Peters in The Times here.] Could you just recap again why you decided to come out when you did, and if you feel you’ve handled that in a way — what emotional residue is left over from that? You feel you hid too long? Or do you — what’s the residual of that previous hidden life?	47	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	PB: Well, between the time I figured out I was gay and the time I came out, was a period of consciously avoiding love, and that has a certain cost, it has a certain weight. On the other hand, I was also very busy in a very meaningful and very fulfilling job, certainly during my time as mayor. So, I’m not sure I felt the cost as keenly as I would have if I were working 40 hours a week or if I had a job that didn’t give me as much meaning, which I think numbed me a little bit to the effect.	48	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	What put me over the edge was the experience of the deployment, where you have that experience where you write the letter, and you put it where your folks can find it if you don’t come back. [The Times’s podcast “The Daily” has an episode focused on Mr. Buttigieg’s decision to come out, featured in its series of interviews with candidates on pivotal moments in their lives. Listen here.] And I remember writing words that I really meant about how I did not want anyone to think, if my life were short, that I had been cheated because I’d had such a full and wonderful life, even at a young age. But also, knowing that I was preparing for the risk of dying at an age where most of my peers had something I didn’t, which is to know what it was like to be in love. And that was untenable.	49	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	So, by the time I came back, I knew I had to do it, but there was the question of how. Right? By then “don’t ask, don’t tell” was over, so it didn’t mean ending my military career. There was every indication it might mean ending my political career. And I reached the conclusion that I had to take that risk, that was O.K., but also, I had some measure of faith in my community, that at least my current job might be something that I could earn another shot at based on the work I did. But as somebody who lives in Indiana, and needless to say, as somebody who was not computing the possibility of running for president in 2020 when I was going through these personal deliberations in 2015, I recognized that it might constrain, not to say end, a political future I would have in Indiana. As to what it means big picture, I’ll tell you. A couple of things that it means right now, which are very powerful, which is young people letting me know that I’m helping them in some way just by doing this. And not even just young queer people, the really exciting thing — I’ve shared this story many times on the trail — was when a teenager let me know that my campaign helped her feel like she had a sense of belonging in her school and her environment even though she had autism. So, that idea of representing difference in a way that validates others.	50	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

I’m also very mindful from a historic perspective that usually when somebody had — well, we don’t have nearly enough examples, but when somebody’s broken a barrier going into the presidency, it’s usually not been the first person to make the attempt. So, the first woman president will not be the first woman to run for president. The first African-American president was not the first African-American to run for president. So, analytically, I’m conscious of the fact that I seek the presidency, if elected, I’d be the first out gay president, and I’m the first elected official to make the attempt. [The first woman to run for president is often credited as Victoria Woodhull, a stockbroker and newspaper publisher who ran in 1872.

PB: Well, I don’t want to sit around thinking about it, but it’s certainly there. Sure, yeah, of course, but so is every — look, when you put your name on the ballot, and you’ve got organizers who attach their name to yours and drop what they’re doing and skip college to go to Iowa and help you, and people give you their money for your campaign, and some of them tell you that they’re passing up a vacation so that they can contribute to your campaign.

We talked to people about balancing the tickets. MC: Things like that. PB: So, first of all, the choice of a running mate is the one choice a candidate makes that is actually a presidential choice. The whole country has to live with it. And so, in a way, retroactively, it’s your first decision as president. And for that reason I think you have to have this deadly serious bar that it’s really about who is best positioned to lead the country in the event that I get killed or I’m unable to serve, and everything else has to follow that.	54	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	Having said that, whether we’re talking about running mates or whether we’re talking about my vision for how to build out a cabinet, yes, balance is extremely important. Racial balance, gender balance, balance in experience, having a shared worldview but different strengths and weaknesses is important. And so, I’ve made a decision that I should not say anything that would disqualify anybody from being considered, but in addition to balance and diversity and range — this, by the way, another reason I pledged the 50 percent women minimum cabinet. [In Mr. Buttigieg’s agenda promoting women’s rights, he committed to nominating women to 50 percent of his cabinet positions and judicial seats. He also said he would put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill and create a commission to ensure there are more national monuments for women.] I’m looking for truth tellers because I’ve always relied on those I’m with and certainly in my administration, also in my campaign, to be there to tell me things I wish weren’t true or would rather not hear. And that quality, I imagine this is especially important in a vice president, not to mention a running mate.	55	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

Cleaning up the campaign finance system is a big issue for Democrats. They won big on it with the midterms.

I mean, we are getting ready to go into the fight of our lives against Donald Trump and his allies, that last time I checked, put together something like 125 million bucks in the last quarter. Right? And tying a hand behind our back to satisfy a purity test is not going to help us deliver the actual structural change that’s needed. [Senators Warren and Sanders are refusing high-dollar private fund-raisers — which Mr. Buttigieg refers to as a “purity test.”] So, I don’t take corporate PAC money because I think it’s important to live that ideal. I also have 700,000, I think, individual contributors, and I obviously don’t know most of them personally. Right? And I imagine they don’t agree with me on everything, they don’t agree with each other on everything, but I certainly believe in grass roots organization building. And the office of mayor of South Bend, Ind., is not generally known as an establishment fund-raising powerhouse. Right? So, we got to where we are with a message and a vision that’s compelling, and my message, whether it’s to young progressives or to moderates or to the future former Republicans I’m finding out there on the trail is, “Look at what we could do as a country.” And if that message is compelling, I have to believe that’s what will decide this election.	57	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

We have about four more pages of questions here, so we’re going to turn to another topic. Lauren Kelley: Mr. Mayor, I wanted to ask you a little bit about reproductive rights. When you’ve talked about your support for abortion rights, you’ve in the past said that you’ve taken cues from the Bible. [In a radio interview last September, Mr. Buttigieg said the Bible has guided his views on reproductive rights. He said, “You know, there’s a lot of parts of the Bible that talk about how life begins with breath, and so even that is something that we can interpret differently.”] I’m curious how you connect with both voters and lawmakers who have a very different interpretation from the Bible, that abortion is a sin or even akin to murder, or do you even try to change their minds or reach them?	58	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	PB: First of all, my interpretation of my religion has no business being imposed on anyone else through policy. So, I’ve occasionally shared my own understanding of the verses beginning with Genesis about the breath of life, that associate the beginning of life with breath, but that is a personal encounter with scripture that is not for anybody else to have to live with from a policy perspective. PB: I think that different people reach different good-faith conclusions about when life begins, which is a metaphysical and, in certain ways, unknowable question. [Times columnist Ross Douthat responded to Mr. Buttigieg’s comments on biblical verse and reproductive freedom here.]Which is exactly why I think the consensus, or at least the decision we’ve got to reach, is not to convince one another to draw the same line in the same place, but to reach a decision, or consensus, about who gets to draw the line. Not where to draw the line, but who should run the line.	59	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	LK: So, I appreciate that you take your biblical interpretation out of the policy arena, but that’s certainly not true of the other side. Right? PB: True. Yeah, yeah. And this is the problem, right? This is the problem with certain versions of how some people want to bring religion into politics, which is not just as a formation of conscience. I think we have an obligation to be transparent about how our conscience is formed, but something that they believe others ought to have to live by. And obviously, as a member of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, I’ve seen the consequences of other people believing their interpretation of their religion ought to be imposed on me.

PB: Well, in my view, it’s the woman facing the decision. Now, societally, we do have some broad boundaries. You look at the Roe v. Wade framework that has early in pregnancy, very few restrictions, and late in pregnancy, very few exceptions. So, at the broadest level, there’s some societal and legal norms, but we view this, ultimately, as an individual choice. And this is another example of something that most Americans believe. You wouldn’t know it. LK: Yeah. Most of Americans believe it, but that framework that you’re talking about, Roe, is being chipped away at.

And it will continue on all fronts, executive, judicial and legislative, which is why I’m determined to make sure my appointments to the judiciary share my understanding of freedom. My executive actions — some of which can be done right away, think about the Title X gag rule. Right?

But also, that we put more legislative backing behind things like the need to encode Roe, and the need to withdraw things like the Hyde Amendment, that are de facto restrictions that make it impossible to access abortion care for those who are low income.

PB: Well, first of all and understanding, most importantly, an understanding of freedom that includes not just the “freedom from” that is, I think, the only side of freedom that some of our conservative friends are able to see, but also “freedom to” live a life of your choosing and the fact that makes a claim. And understanding the importance of our proactive positive freedoms, from abortion rights to voting rights, and what that means for our ability to thrive and to live lives of our choosing and to function as a country. KK: Can you talk a little bit about your plan, the 15-member Supreme Court plan that you’ve proposed?

2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	PB: Yeah. So, again, I do not want to claim credit for having invented this, but it was published in the Yale Law Journal, I think in the current edition, as part of an article contemplating options for structural reform that go beyond the debate about court packing. [Read Daniel Epps and Ganesh Sitaraman’s “How to Save the Supreme Court.”] I’m not talking about changing the court in order to make it more liberal. My appointments will make it more liberal, at least by the likes of the way these debates are tracked. But I’m talking about a structural reform to change the political stakes of judicial appointments. And the one you’re mentioning that I think deserves to be considered is called a balanced bench. And the idea is you have 15 justices overall, 10 of them arrive in the traditional, you might say, partisan process that we’re used to. The other five can only be seated by a unanimous agreement of the other 10. And the idea is that there will be a depoliticization of those choices. And it might be on a rotating basis. I think the authors in the Yale Law Journal suggest that they be rotated up from the appellate bench. That gets you away from these strange phenomena like the Kennedy brief, where a whole body of casework is done to appeal to the idiosyncrasies of a single perceived swing justice.	66	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

A different version that is also contemplated in that article would be to make the entire court rotated on and off the appellate bench. Very interesting debate over whether that would even require constitutional reform or whether you could do it by law. By the way, even though this is admittedly bold, it is far from unprecedented for there to be changes to the size and makeup of the court. It’s happened in a substantial way about half a dozen times. I would argue the Republicans changed the size of the Supreme Court to eight until they took power again, very recently.

PB: So, that’s false, and I reject any reporting, some of which I’ve seen, I believe some of it coming from this building, that suggests that I backed away from it. I talk about it in virtually every stump speech that I give, and it is, by the way, kind of a tough sell in places like New Hampshire, but I want to make sure that people in New Hampshire hear something that’s not that different from what I have to say when I’m in Manhattan.

It doesn’t even privilege small states. One of the principled arguments for it would be the small states get overlooked, but it doesn’t, it just privileges some states. Right? Small states like Rhode Island get ignored or Wyoming, and big states like Texas or New York get ignored.

I didn’t mean to cut you off. I just get frustrated when it is implied that I talk about this less today than I did six months ago. KK: All right. Charlie Warzel: If I could pivot to technology and your tech policy. You’ve spoken, and I believe you told Vox recently, that breaking up Big Tech should be an option. [Mr. Buttigieg was somewhat vague in his response to Vox on whether Big Tech should be broken up. He said, “We will rigorously enforce the law, and if they continue the behavior, breaking up tech companies should be an option.”] It seems like your proposal is somewhat more vague than some of your opponents’. One of the things you mentioned was doubling antitrust enforcement budgets. Can you tell me a little bit about how you plan to go about evaluating whether breaking up should happen? For Facebook, for example, do you think Facebook should be broken up right now?	71	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	PB: Yeah. So, I think there’s a strong case for that. The reason I don’t think it makes sense for me to say as a candidate, “This company shall be broken up,” is the same reason I wouldn’t generally say of the outcome of a trial in a judicial process. This —— CW: But you can think about their power, right? Right now, as you see the influence that they have in modern politics —— PB: Absolutely. Yeah. CW: —— and say, “This needs to change.” PB: Yes.

Pricing power is not the biggest worry around the harms that the scope and power of Facebook and other large tech companies have accumulated is, right? The way I would think about it is to, first of all, break out certain things that I think are conflated in the frustrations and anger directed toward big companies. One set of issues has to do with data security and data privacy. That requires a national data law and stronger privacy and security protections, but frankly, dealing with the monopoly problem is neither necessary nor sufficient to fix that. [Mr. Buttigieg has said he would work with Congress to pass a federal privacy bill and double funding for antitrust enforcement.] In other words, that’s a stand-alone set of issues that has to happen, because a small company could misbehave with data, too.	73	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

CW: If that was happening during your administration, theoretically, you would have vocally supported blocking that? PB: Yeah. Again, the president doesn’t sit there and direct how an administrative process is going to come out, but yes, there needs to be a prior review. At a certain level, instead of the burden being on the state to demonstrate that some of these mergers will be harmful, I think the burden should be on the company to demonstrate that they won’t.	74	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

I mean, the idea that maybe they’re not adequately afraid of you? KK: Can you also speak to your relationship with Mark Zuckerberg?

So, we were in college at the same time, got a lot of mutual friends, and it doesn’t mean we agree on a lot of things.

Now, part of the problem is that a social network is a natural monopoly, right? So, if we were just talking about the, what you might call the Facebook part of Facebook, the product that people are most familiar with, if you broke that up, you just wind up with two of them and one of them would die and one of them would be the new one. The real problem is how a corporation of that size acquires other competitors and develops certain powers. And then, there’s a problem of their refusal to accept their responsibility for speech that they make money from. So, if a cable company, or a newspaper, if somebody can show that an ad that you all were going to run is false, you would pull it, and yet Facebook doesn’t want to hold themselves to that same standard.

I mean, is Silicon Valley adequately afraid of you? There are other candidates who have used much more bold, intense, I don’t know —— [Mr. Zuckerberg said, in audio leaked to The Verge, that having Senator Warren as president would “suck” for Facebook.] PB: Yes. And some of them seem to get a lot of support out of Silicon Valley, too, so I don’t know. I think you got a lot of folks there who are maybe a little less ideological, who I’m not going to agree with on everything, but also a lot of folks who, I think, are wrestling with what it is they’ve created. The problem is, it shouldn’t just be left to companies to decide how to solve these problems. There needs to be a policy response. Basically what we’ve done is we’ve outsourced public policy decisions around the limits of speech and misinformation and the handling and the use of data to the companies, which are so big that when they make a corporate policy decision, in effect, they’re actually making a public policy decision. They do it.	77	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Which is how they make their money, right? Although, I would say that the nonrevenue vitality of social media is just as problematic as the paid stuff. KK: We only have about half an hour left, so I want to turn to foreign policy, but before we do, I wanted to ask you one question which we are asking all of our candidates, which is, who has broken your heart? PB: I mean, Boston College. I was 11 years old. We were this close to the National Championship. And they came to South Bend, we were one game away, we had beaten Florida State, become No. 1. [In 1993, Notre Dame’s football team was undefeated and top ranked until it lost to the Boston College Eagles, 41-39, at home in the final game of the regular season.

St Augustine is one of his major religious influences.] Given your faith, how do you reconcile directing the largest, most powerful military in the world with your Christian obligation to love your neighbor? Or enemy. Excuse me. And your neighbor, but mostly your enemies. PB: It’s one of the biggest problems of being involved in the military at any level, and I suppose we’re all implicated in this just by belonging to this country. You also have to rationalize, as a citizen, how you participate in a society or a country that sometimes does things that are, even when it’s doing the so-called right thing, from the perspective of law, or the law of war, is still doing something that would not be considered Christian or moral by the lights of any number of different faith traditions. Some people take the approach of punching out completely, right? That’s the Walden approach, I guess.

And that’s true for, I think, any position of executive leadership, but certainly when you’re in charge of a government body or a military unit or the entire country and making those life and death decisions. That’s what you have to weigh. It’s not finding what the perfect answer is. Well, it isn’t a McKinsey puzzle where you might be able to compute the right answer.

Can you make the case for why we need to have an American presence in, for instance, the African nation of Mali? PB: So, we need to maintain the ability to project force in a way that will protect the homeland and meet our core security and national objectives. What I will also say is that there are a lot of troops deployed around the world right now, pursuant to an A.U.M.F., that was passed to deal with 9/11.

PB: Yeah. Is that under the A.U.M.F.? I’d have to think about how those two strands connected. But the point is, the A.U.M.F. had no sunset, and the scope creep most recently, I think, brought to life by the Afghanistan Papers, but we’ve been looking at it for more than a decade, is one of the reasons why I believe that a future A.U.M.F. should always have a three-year sunset.

And by the way, this also helps with the fact that Congress has been all too happy, I think, not to get involved in questions like whether the A.U.M.F. that was supposed to deal with 9/11 justifies troops being in Mali or Niger. So, some of these deployments are problematic, and we need a much more crisply defined mission both for the war on terror in general and for future military engagements, even while recognizing that we are going to have a base architecture globally that ensures that we maintain global military superiority, especially as we get into a more and more multipolar world.	83	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

PB: Angered, but honestly, not completely surprised. I remember these debates raging in the time that I was deployed, and you could argue that was very late in the war. In fact, I thought it was the end of the war. I thought I was one of the last troops turning out the lights, and that was years ago. And I even remember they posted one of those inscrutable PowerPoints on the wall of the gym by the treadmills.

AK: Possibly impossible? PB: Let me rephrase. Well, it’s not that it’s impossible. They’re not impossible. It’s not impossible for Afghanistan to become a thriving, prosperous, democratic state, but it is impossible for that to happen quickly.

How would you do it any sort of quicker? PB: Trump’s administration is not big on decision making and also not big on multilateral diplomacy. Look, in order to do this, the thing we have going for us is that leaving Afghanistan is possibly the one thing that all of the parties think ought to happen. The U.S. left, the U.S. right, the international community, the Taliban and in the long run the Afghan government all want to see this happen. [A 2018 poll from YouGov found that 61 percent of Americans support a withdrawal from Afghanistan.] So the question is when we leave, are we going to leave well or are we going to leave poorly? What leaving well looks like is to make sure that there is some kind of negotiated political settlement that gets us here. Not based on a spontaneous invitation to Camp David, but based on a proper level of engagement with the government, which has been sidelined for most of this from what I can tell. The Afghan government, I mean, the Taliban and regional players that play a hugely important role in that area. I’m thinking about Pakistan in particular.	86	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

PB: Well, look at what we had in northern Syria, a very minimal, light, specialized presence of intelligence and special ops capability that was able to, while they were there, hold the line. Not by assuming responsibility for stability and prosperity of Syria, but by preventing the worst outcomes and being able to alert the United States command when there were likely to be things that could imperil our troops or the homeland.

That every time the United States has tried to pursue its interest at the expense of its values, sooner or later that’s caught up to us.

It’s not doing somebody a favor. At least applying for asylum is recognized as a right. It’s one of many things that need to change quickly by way of administrative action.

As to what you’re saying in terms of the administration’s posture toward the countries whose misery, often, is propelling this wave of migration, it is perfectly self-defeating to threaten to withdraw aid from, for example, the Central American Triangle countries when by far the best way forward to prevent a migration crisis in our interest is to make sure that people are living prosperous or at least minimally can count on safety in their own home countries. Part of which can be supported with American investment.

And I think that this administration, if they wanted to, could have passed comprehensive immigration reform and taken credit for the achievement. Unfortunately, this president believes that it is more useful for him to divide us around the failure than it is for him to take credit for the achievement, and so we continue entering our 35th year or so since there’s been meaningful reform.

Research to develop nuclear possibilities that don’t have those risks or don’t produce that kind of waste, of course we should be pursuing that.

I don’t think there’s anything fanciful about this because you can just look at the political life of the A.C.A., which again was toxic for Democrats in 2010 when I was getting crushed in my first experience on the ballot in Indiana, and by 2018 was the winning issue for Democrats such that even when the Republicans controlled everything, they could not make good on their central campaign promise, even when they were in charge. [In 2017, Mr. Trump claimed “we have essentially repealed Obamacare.” In fact, the Affordable Care Act has grown only more popular — a Kaiser Family Foundation poll in 2018 found the law’s favorability at 54 percent, its highest point since it began surveying people about it in 2010.] Right? So we know that when we restore the center of gravity of politics to the lived experience of Americans who are affected by political decisions and not the noise that this president creates, we have a winning hand to get these policies through.	105	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

So we’ve scored it at $1.5 trillion over 10 years. [Mayor Buttigieg’s campaign said his health care plan, “Medicare for all who want it,” would be almost entirely paid for by rolling Mr. Trump’s corporate tax cuts back to 35 percent rates.] In order to achieve that, actually a fully 1.4 of it can be recouped just from rolling back the corporate tax rate portion of the Trump tax cuts. For the other 0.1, $100 billion, I would account that as part of the savings that we will get from the negotiation of prescription drug prices by Medicare and H.H.S., which I think narrowly that move alone C.B.O. had between $3 billion and $400 billion over a decade. We believe the overall savings to the Treasury of the different moves we aim to make would come to over $600 billion. Anyway, I only need 0.1 to make up the gap between 1.4 and 1.5 [trillion].	106	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

JI: $1.5 trillion is a lot less than Medicare for all, than Elizabeth Warren’s plan would cost, right? [Senator Warren’s “Medicare for all” plan is estimated to cost $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next decade. Read how she did her math in the Upshot.] But that’s over 10 years. If your plan succeeds and more people choose the public option versus private insurance beyond 10 years, it could become quite expensive. What do you say to arguments that ultimately it would be just as expensive as something like Medicare for all, so why not just do that?	107	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	PB: Well, the problem with Medicare for all or that version of Medicare for all that my competitors have isn’t just the cost. I certainly believe that when you propose something with a cost, you got to be able to explain how to pay it. And that’s a problem there. It’s also the idea of dictating to people what their choice ought to be. You look at the plans that a lot of folks, including a lot of folks in labor, have fought for, sometimes trading off wages to get them. They’re not interested in being kicked off the plan. I think just baking that little bit of humility into the policy pays off because it also, it’s not just — sorry — but it’s not just the problem of dictating that this plan will be better. There’s a comparable danger of policy arrogance in supposing that we can guess from Washington the correct number of years before the transition should happen. So what I’m supporting is a way for the transition to be organic.	108	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

With respect to the public option being a better choice and that’s the thing that’s often used to kind of promote the idea. How do you make that work if doctors and hospitals can simply choose not to accept the public option as long as private still exists? How do you address that concern in your thinking? PB: So I believe the economy of scale, especially if you compare it to Medicare, right? The places where Medicare is accepted indicate that as long as a reimbursement is appropriate, that there should not be a problem on the provider side.

NF: If you don’t mind, I wanted to get back to what Aisha was saying. I found your answer to her kind of vague, quite vague, and I thought she was asking something really important. A lot of young people and not so young people are disgusted by growing up in a system in which they’re seeing more and more of the wealth of the country going to a smaller and smaller group of people at the expense of everyone else. That small group of people having an increasing amount of political and economic power. Some of your opponents have had very clear solutions or what they call very clear solutions for those problems. I’m wondering if in that time we have, if you could give specific solutions to say what the government could do to address the growing financial inequities, what the government could do about the power of the financial industry, about the corruption of politics, about the corruption of industry itself?	110	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

That’s everything from my proposal to double the rate of unionization in this country, to my insistence that we increase the minimum wage to some of the other labor market reforms I’ve proposed around taking care of contractors and gig workers, to campaign-finance reforms up to and including a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United. [Mr. Buttigieg is one of several candidates who have earned the approval of the grass roots group End Citizens United for his commitment to anti-corruption legislation. He defended his intent to use a constitutional amendment to do so, arguing: “Does anybody really think we’re going to overtake Citizens United without constitutional action?

I believe that we need to be investing in the sources of social mobility and domestic competitiveness to include my proposal that we triple funding for Title I in education, to include everything that’s contemplated in the Douglass Plan, to include what we need to do around infrastructure. [Mr. Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Sanders have all pledged to triple Title I funding for low-income schools, and Senator Warren has pledged to quadruple it.] And that in order to do that, we must raise taxes on wealthy individuals and on corporations.

Close the 199A loophole, deal with some of the enforcement deficiencies that are driving the big part of the revenue gap right now I think. I’m also open to a wealth tax. I just would not put my signature proposal in a position of being completely dependent on a tax that is constitutionally untested. [In the December Democratic debate, Mr. Buttigieg criticized Senator Warren’s wealth tax plan as “extreme.” He cautioned that candidates should “be smart about the promises we’re making, make sure they’re promises we can keep.”] In principle I think it’s fine.

I think part of this might be a question of tone, too. I think that the younger I was, the more I was inclined to think about politics as combat. Having been responsible for a city, I think about it differently today, but what I don’t view as different is the importance of restoring power to workers and citizens. When I say power, I mean both political power and wealth, which becomes both economic and political power at the expense of those who have concentrated it too much in today’s world.	114	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	NF: How would you double unionization? PB: So part of it has to do with who can organize. Making it possible, for example, for gig workers to organize, as I’ve called for. Making it possible for there to be more scope for multi-employer bargaining. If you are one of those fast-food workers and you’re in a McDonald’s and there’s an Arby’s across the street, you should be able to team up. Part of it is how you can unionize. We have penalties for company interference in union elections, but the penalties are so weak that even when they are imposed by what I view as a much-weakened enforcement structure — both in terms of the Department of Labor and N.L.R.B. — even when they are imposed, they’re not really enough to change behavior. Which is why I’ve specified the need for fines in the adequate range of the multimillions that would actually make it a different calculation for companies to make it difficult to unionize and we need an end to right-to-work. Right-to-work is a restriction. It’s talked about differently in conservative political language, but it is a restriction on the ability of employers and employees to negotiate, and I would remove it. [The Times editorial board weighed in on the importance of centering labor issues in the 2020 campaign, particularly ideas like sectoral bargaining and prohibiting “right to work” laws, which allow workers in union workplaces to refuse union membership.]	115	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Rape, robbery, and assaults are all crimes that are at much higher rates in South Bend than they are for example in New York City or in Indiana versus New York. [Since 2012, Mr. Buttigieg’s first year in office, South Bend has averaged 5,890 reported serious crimes a year, down from an average of 6,845 in the three years prior. According to The South Bend Tribune, burglaries declined under his administration, but aggravated assaults increased.] Why haven’t you been able to do much about those types of crimes?	116	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE

We have group violence intervention that has been able to deal with gang and group violence and in particular gun violence in our city, hasn’t ended it. We’ve had some terrible years, but my first year we had 18 homicides, I believe, and we have been able to see a shift in that. [The South Bend Group Violence Intervention strategy was introduced to the city in 2013 with the aim of curbing gun violence. The strategy, developed by David Kennedy at John Jay College, relies on direct communication with people most likely to commit violence.]	117	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The per capita personal income in my city has finally gone above $20,000. We have poverty rates similar to Baltimore’s, but in many of these categories, crime rates there are different. [The poverty rate in South Bend is estimated at 25.4 percent. The poverty rate in Baltimore is estimated at 23.8 percent.] Now having said that, I should also mention that you brought up at least two categories of crime, rape and aggravated assault, where reporting has changed. And it is my fervent hope without coming over and telling you what to do that when folks report on in particular data that is compiled in the F.B.I.’s uniform crime database, U.C.R. database, that attention is paid to the language warning about why it is not a good idea to compare between the different jurisdictions due to reporting differences and also some of the pitfalls of reporting over the years when some of the standards changed.	118	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

PB: Say again? NF: Haven’t the reporting standards for aggravated assault changed for other jurisdictions, too? PB: Yes and no. So what happened with rape was a nationwide change in the U.C.R. reporting standards and so you can even break out what is called legacy rate and the new standard. [In 2012, the attorney general announced a new and more expansive definition of rape, a victory for survivors and advocates. The definition is available on the Department of Justice’s website here.] In the case of aggravated assault, I know of changes that happened that led to more reporting of it in my jurisdiction. I don’t know how much that’s part of moves that have been made in other police departments.	119	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

PB: I believe police officers by and large get up in the morning and do their job no matter what’s happening in politics. I do think that there is a cost to reductions in police legitimacy that come about, especially when there are cases of abuses both from around the country and what happens in any local area. What we’re seeing a lot are cycles of gun violence, assault too, but especially with gun violence where you have a family, someone is attacked or killed. The family weighs whether to take that to the police or to handle that in a way that leads to more violence and so the less comfort there is reaching out to the police, the more likely it is that there will be contagion between one violent act and another. That’s actually even more true as you get out of the ones that we’ve been better able to get a grasp on through our group violence intervention strategy where it’s connected to, whether it’s a formal gang or what’s called a group, it can often be comparatively easier to map and enforce on the associations that lead to that violence than when you have looser associations and sometimes families.	120	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Is that a fair criticism? KK: I want to be respectful of the mayor’s time, so after this maybe we can ask you one last question and then we’ll let you go. Is that O.K? PB: Sure, yeah. So our effort on vacant and abandoned houses was very much about directing dollars for improvement in low-income and predominantly minority neighborhoods. Because the No. 1 thing I heard knocking on doors in those neighborhoods from voters and residents when I was a candidate was why has there been a collapsing house next door to me for 12 years?

So when it falls, it’s in bad shape and it falls to eight or nine thousand bucks. [In 2017, the median property value of a house in South Bend was $81,100, according to Data USA. Nationally that figure is closer to $217,600.] Someone who just owns this as a line on a spreadsheet anyway, and they’re not even from in town, just walks away. They don’t even bother selling it or disposing of it, or they cleverly hide who owns it. Anyway, my point is we directed dollars to remove the houses that couldn’t be saved and to improve the houses that could precisely because of the importance of supporting low-income neighborhoods.	122	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2020-01-16	New York Times (Online)	Pete Buttigieg Says He’s More Than a Résumé	txt-opeds/2339458287.xml.txt	So while we did a lot of work in our downtown for sure, and I’m proud of the fact that a downtown that used to be characterized as dead or dying is growing. It’s equally important to me, if not more so, that we’ve created opportunity for folks around the city and that we’ve invested directly in neighborhoods. We’ve also invested directly in home repair, knowing that there’s not only a moral and economic empowerment rationale for keeping people in their home, but frankly it’s also a public safety rationale. There are a lot of folks in these neighborhoods who are not afraid of the police or don’t respect the police, but they respect Grandma. And I want Grandma to be able to afford to own her home, stay there and be on her porch, as part of what keeps the fabric of the neighborhood intact and makes it safer. So there have been justified critiques that we may have used code enforcement as a blunt instrument in some cases and listening to neighborhood feedback improve that over time, but it’s very important to me that it’d be understood that our effort to direct dollars, whether it was for demolishing collapsing structures or for enhancing ones that could be saved, was very much about supporting low-income residents.	123	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Medicare-for-all: $17.5 trillion Total: $54.6 trillion We can round off the total to $50 trillion. The object is not a precise estimate down to the last penny. The goal is to determine a correct order of magnitude for Sanders's plans. An estimate by the Progressive Policy Institute, a research and advocacy group, reached a similar total: $53 trillion. To put these numbers in perspective, the CBO projects that, under existing laws, the federal government will spend $60.7 trillion over a decade. If Sanders's program costs $50 trillion over the same period, the size of government would expand by roughly 80 percent. If all the spending were covered by deficits, the publicly held federal debt would rise from $16.8 trillion in 2019 to $66.8 trillion in 2030.

The presumption seems to be that if you want a new social program, whether Medicaid-for-all or free college, all you have to do is dial it up and the super-rich will pay for it. This is a fantasy that, unfortunately, is sustained by simplistic media coverage that ignores the collective impact of all these various proposals.

About half of the wealth of the rich is contained in privately held businesses that, unlike publicly traded stocks, are hard to value. He thinks the tax would raise far less than expected.

Sanders and Warren advocate a high-tax-and-benefits system, patterned on European welfare states. Government expands power at the expense of private control. In truth, we've already gone a considerable distance down this path. Do we want to go further? Our society is part socialist and part capitalist.

The model also says the economy under Ms. Warren's wealth tax would be about 1% to 2% smaller in 2050, compared with the baseline, though the exact outcome depends on whether Congress spent the revenue in ways that lifted productivity.

We then have a choice: Pretend debt doesn't matter or try to close the gap between revenue and expenditures. At some point debt matters a great deal — retarding growth and gobbling up revenue simply to service existing debt, for example. Alas, government is not like a household (or a business) and, therefore, some reasonable level of debt is acceptable.

Republicans made matters worse, reducing revenue, by selling the same supply-side chestnut to the American people when they voted for tax cuts. It'll pay for itself! It'll permanently hike growth! No, and no. It dramatically increased the debt in exchange for at most a temporary bump in growth, already dissipating before our eyes.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

For example, the United States should eliminate the provision that forgives unpaid capital gains taxes on assets held at death. And there are many loopholes that could be closed in the name of greater equity. In 2016, the Obama administration provided a helpful list of candidates: They range from jettisoning the special deductions and credits that producers of fossil fuels enjoy to eliminating the notorious carried interest provision, which allows private equity managers (including me) to pay the lower capital gains rate on what is effectively ordinary income.

2019-04-10	Wall Street Journal (Online)	Ron Wyden's Plan to Drain Investors; A new Democratic idea to grab revenue: Tax unrealized capital gains.	txt-opeds/2206634475.xml.txt	The Democratic competition to bleed the rich has become fierce. If progressives aren't satisfied with Elizabeth Warren's proposed ""wealth tax"" of 3% a year, AOC's 70% income tax, Bernie Sanders's 77% estate tax, or Rep. John Larson's uncapped payroll-tax increase of 2.4 percentage points, they now have a fifth option. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden wants to tax capital gains as regular income, meaning rates up to 37%. He would also tax unrealized gains, perhaps decades before the investor sells. Mr. Wyden hasn't released a formal plan, so the details are sketchy. Under current law, long-term capital gains are taxed at rates up to 20%—plus a 3.8% ObamaCare surcharge on investment income—only after the asset is sold.	0	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE

""There are two tax codes in America,"" he said recently. ""The first is for nurses, police officers and factory workers—those who earn wages and pay taxes with every paycheck. The second is for millionaires and billionaires."" But there are good reasons to tax capital gains at preferential rates, which is why the U.S. has done it for decades under Democrats and Republicans. The lower rate encourages investment and productive risk-taking. It reduces the harm from double taxation after corporations already pay income taxes. It also assists the mobility of capital by reducing the ""lock-in effect"" from investors holding assets to avoid taxes.	1	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

A lower tax rate is also a matter of fairness. If investors have capital losses, they aren't allowed to deduct more than $3,000 a year. There's no inflation adjustment either: If $100 of stock bought in 1999 is sold for $150 today, the difference is taxed even though much of it is an illusory gain caused by dollar erosion. Many people who have capital gains are ""rich"" for a year, after a lifetime of letting an investment build value before they sell. Capital gains aren't taxed like salaries, in other words, because they're different from salaries. Mr. Wyden's plan would treat capital gains as ordinary income and deliver a gut-punch to investors and the economy. Mr. Wyden also proposes an annual ""mark to market"" scheme, which would spread the tax over the lifetime of the investment. As an asset rises in value, its owners would pay tax each year on the incremental gain.	3	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE
2019-04-10	Wall Street Journal (Online)	Ron Wyden's Plan to Drain Investors; A new Democratic idea to grab revenue: Tax unrealized capital gains.	txt-opeds/2206634475.xml.txt	This would create an enormous new accounting burden. Mr. Wyden may say that his mark-to-market rule will apply only to the top 1% or 0.1%, but it would still be a bonanza for tax attorneys. How will people in the top 2% know whether they've passed the threshold, and how far will they go to avoid it? When future progressives are scrounging for yet more tax revenue, they will inevitably lower Mr. Wyden's threshold. Nearly a third of U.S. households—roughly 40 million—have some kind of taxable investment account, according to survey data from the Finra Investor Education Foundation. If Mr. Wyden creates another way to wring taxes out of people, it's hard to imagine Congress restraining itself.	4	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

Imagine a doctor investing in stocks in a taxable brokerage account. In good times he'll have to divert money to pay the annual tax, since the unrealized gain isn't in his bank account. Then what if the market crashes as he retires, erasing the gain—or turning it into a sudden loss? Could the doctor call the IRS to get a refund for years of taxes? And what about illiquid investments, such as private companies or real estate? As with Ms. Warren's suggested wealth tax, no one knows how Mr. Wyden would go about valuing them. Politico reported, citing the Senator's spokeswoman, that his plan ""would have exemptions for personal residences and retirement accounts while applying broadly to other tradeable and nontradeable assets.""	5	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE

Taxing years of appreciation on the land could force them to sell the place. Would the owner of an apartment building be asked to revalue it every year? Will an art investor be told to mark that Picasso to market? Good luck. Academic papers suggest that maybe the IRS could tax some ""expected return"" each year. Or perhaps the tax would be collected only when the asset is sold, but calculated as if it had been applied annually, with the rate of appreciation drawn as a straight line. Mr. Wyden's detailed thinking isn't known, but however he tries to skin the fat cat, it will add unhelpful complexity to the revenue code.	6	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	FALSE

2021-10-26	The Washington Post (Online)	How Twitter became the media of America’s left	txt-opeds/2586208367.xml.txt	The refrain ""Twitter is not real life"" is meant to be a criticism of the platform, and those who use it, as overly liberal and activist and not representative of everyday Americans. But I always think: ""No, it's not — and thank God for that."" Twitter has filled a huge void for people such as me who prefer more left-wing politicians such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over more moderate Democrats and want to see the country move aggressively in a more progressive direction. In fact, Twitter is in many ways America's true left-wing news outlet. But the benefits of Twitter for the left also come with some costs.	0	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-26	The Washington Post (Online)	How Twitter became the media of America’s left	txt-opeds/2586208367.xml.txt	You might wonder why the left needs Twitter — after all, Republicans argue the news media is basically a left-wing propaganda machine. That's nonsense, of course. I would concede that it's unlikely many journalists voted for Donald Trump, and major media outlets in America are usually based in large cities and their employees generally share those cities' cultural values, such as supporting same-sex marriage. But mainstream outlets including The Post, the New York Times and NPR explicitly seek to appeal to Republicans, too, sometimes falling into flawed ""both sides"" coverage along the way. On top of that, most traditional news organizations have a centrist, pro-status-quo bias that comes from them being generally owned by wealthy people or major corporations and staffed largely by upper-income people. So news coverage from those organizations tends to suggest that left-wing Democrats such as Sanders and Warren are out of the mainstream, an approach tilted toward centrism that I think helped Joe Biden win last year's Democratic presidential primaries.	1	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-26	The Washington Post (Online)	How Twitter became the media of America’s left	txt-opeds/2586208367.xml.txt	MSNBC, while being pretty Democratic, isn't as dominant a media source for liberals as Fox News is on the right. And it, too, often hews to an establishment-friendly, status quo coverage. So while there is a lot of media that appeals to center-left Democrats, Twitter has filled a gap for more progressive Democrats. This happened basically by accident. It's not clear that Twitter's Jack Dorsey, who co-founded the company in 2006, is that much more personally liberal than Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg. But nonetheless, in the early 2010s, Twitter became such a popular place for Black Americans to discuss culture, politics and everything else that ""Black Twitter"" became a major phenomenon. Rather than relying on mainstream media, many of the activists who were part of the Black Lives Matter movement used Twitter to organize protests and describe the movement's goals. Twitter also became a place where journalists and academics of all races posted not just their work but also their personal thoughts. And many of the earliest and most enthusiastic adopters of Twitter, as with other new technologies, were young. Any platform drawing heavily on that mix of people was bound to become an important platform on the left.	2	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-26	The Washington Post (Online)	How Twitter became the media of America’s left	txt-opeds/2586208367.xml.txt	It's not that people over 50 or conservatives don't like Twitter (see Trump, Donald) or that every young person is on Twitter. But about 75 percent of Twitter users are under 50, while only about half of the adult population overall is that young, according to the Pew Research Center. Facebook, in contrast, doesn't have a big age disparity. About 70 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds use Facebook, but so do about 70 percent of people 50 to 64, according to Pew. Just 18 percent of those between 50 and 64 use Twitter. What has become more clear is that in some ways Twitter isn't just a media platform for those on the political left, but the media platform for the most progressive Democrats. Plenty of very progressive people consume The Post, the Times, NPR and other mainstream publications. But Twitter is often the place they first look for news each day.	3	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE
2021-10-26	The Washington Post (Online)	How Twitter became the media of America’s left	txt-opeds/2586208367.xml.txt	That's in part because it's a great way to get information that isn't biased toward that centrist, pro-status-quo perspective. I have worked most of my life at very established, traditional institutions (Time magazine, NBC News, now The Post). Twitter has allowed me to build a national network of people with more left-wing and non-traditional interests and perspectives who weren't likely to be hired or fit into a traditional news organization. And that's been so valuable — I have a set of colleagues to collaborate and share ideas with, even if they don't work at the same place I do. So, no, it's ""not real life."" And because so many journalists are on Twitter, left-wing ideas that start there quickly find their way into mainstream media. With Twitter, ""issues and concerns of younger and more left-leaning Democrats that used to be relegated have a better chance at being elevated,"" said Meredith Conroy, a political scientist at California State University at San Bernardino.	4	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE
2021-10-26	The Washington Post (Online)	How Twitter became the media of America’s left	txt-opeds/2586208367.xml.txt	It is hard to imagine the recent ascendance of Black Lives Matter, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and ""the Squad,"" or ideas such as reparations and wealth taxes, without Twitter. But AOC and BLM are still minority voices, not only in America but within the Democratic Party, too. The candidates who supported wealth taxes (Warren, Sanders) didn't win in 2020. And that goes to the limits of Twitter for the left. First, it's a medium that doesn't reach many older Democrats. I tend to think that many Americans will always prefer their news in articles or broadcasts instead of 280-character updates. And in our current media environment, that means that younger Democrats are on Twitter, where left-wing ideas such as reparations, wealth taxes and adding justices to the Supreme Court are discussed favorably, while older Democrats are hearing from NPR and the New York Times how these ideas are risky and controversial.	5	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE
2021-10-26	The Washington Post (Online)	How Twitter became the media of America’s left	txt-opeds/2586208367.xml.txt	It will always be hard for a Bernie Sanders to defeat a Joe Biden if older Democrats mostly get news more oriented toward Biden's point of view. To truly compete, the left needs more broadcast and traditional-style news media to reach those older Democrats. But it's also hard to imagine a truly left-wing media outlet ever being as big and influential as NPR or The Post or the Times. There are a lot of reasons for that, but one of them is that the real audience for a left-wing news outlet — younger Democrats — already has Twitter. ""If you're following politics, you don't have to choose between Slate, Atlantic or Vox,"" said Shannon McGregor, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's school of media and journalism.

Twitter has both democraticized and diversified my information diet — I read a lot of articles and tweets each day, and I don't necessarily consider those that appear in long-standing mainstream outlets more important than those from any other institution, or even from people not affiliated with an institution at all. Thanks to Twitter, many on the left are better informed than they might have been otherwise. And that makes them better and sharper at criticizing those in power and demanding change. But it also might ensure that governing power on the Democratic side is always in the hands of Biden-style Democrats.	7	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE

We're glad to see the new attention to the Internal Revenue Service, and welcome to the cause if you mean it. Messrs. Comey and McCabe were rotten public servants, but any abuse of the IRS for political purposes has to be punished and deterred. The pair tangled with President Trump after investigating him for alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign. Their IRS probes came during the tenure of Commissioner Charles Rettig, whom Mr. Trump appointed in 2018 and who still leads the agency. Mr. Comey's came three months after then-Attorney General William Barr chose not to indict him related to the Russia probe, and Mr. McCabe's began shortly after the Biden Justice Department settled a lawsuit against him.	0	TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE

The IRS says the National Research Program selects a few thousand taxpayers a year for the reviews, chosen by an algorithm based on undisclosed criteria. Mr. Rettig says he played no role in the audits, and on Thursday he asked the agency's inspector general to review how the two former FBI men were chosen for the audit. Good idea. But some Democrats aren't waiting to jump to Trumpian conclusions. ""Trump has no respect for the rule of law,"" said Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden in a statement.

One example is last year's leak of tax records to the progressive website ProPublica. The site published the detailed records of such billionaires as Warren Buffett and Jeff Bezos in June 2021, the same time Democrats were making the case for a wealth tax. The leak was a federal crime, and ProPublica hasn't disclosed its source or how the files were obtained. A year later the IRS still hasn't offered information about the leak to Congress. Not that Mr. Wyden's committee or Democrats on House Ways and Means seem eager to know. The same was true during the Obama years when the IRS subjected conservative nonprofits to undue scrutiny in their applications for tax-exempt status.

In the progressive worldview, America should be preparing for the inevitable Bloomberg inauguration, since campaign spending supposedly works on voters like a Jedi mind trick.

By the way, where was the progressive outcry last month when Mr. Bloomberg said he would transfer $18 million in unspent campaign funds to the Democratic National Committee? That's 500 times the usual limit on what an individual donor can give to his national party's general account.

A megarich candidate can give unlimited cash to his campaign, which can transfer unlimited funds to his party. The vagaries of election law essentially gave Mr. Bloomberg a direct financial pipeline to Democratic headquarters. The Associated Press said Mr. Bloomberg's $18 million bequest was ""the largest single such transfer ever."" At the time, the Democratic National Committee showed only about $14 million cash on hand.
