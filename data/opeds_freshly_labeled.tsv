2020-04-21	New York Times (Online)	A Wealth Tax Is the Logical Way to Support Coronavirus Relief	txt-opeds/2392335478.xml.txt	The precise contours of such a tax obviously require detailed design. Still, a rough outline illustrates the basic idea. The wealthiest 5 percent of American families now hold $57 trillion, or two-thirds of all household wealth in the country (up from about half in 1960). An exemption for the first $2.5 million of household wealth would exclude the bottom 95 percent from paying any tax at all and leave the top 5 percent with total taxable wealth of roughly $40 trillion. A 5 percent tax on the richest 5 percent of households could thus raise up to $2 trillion.	2	1	2	1

Job recruiters understand this. Virtually all universities and now many companies have D&I departments, for diversity and inclusion. Sounds worthy. But as far as I can tell, the No. 1 job of a D&I department is to hire more people into the D&I department. No one ever mentions excellence.	1	0	0	0

But legislators want to raise taxes anyway	txt-opeds/2524189439.xml.txt	It’s income tax time across America, but in the California Legislature it is always tax time. Some Democrats never stop trying to raise taxes. It seems addictive. Never mind that Californians already pay the highest state taxes in the nation. Moreover, Sacramento is hauling in so much revenue that the state government is accumulating a huge surplus and is close to being legally forced to return some of the money to taxpayers. Yet, during the young legislative session lawmakers have already proposed raising taxes and fees by an unbelievable $234 billion annually, according to the California Tax Foundation. That’s a research nonprofit founded decades ago by the California Taxpayers Assn., an anti-tax lobby.	0	0	0	3

Ed Kleinbard knew more about taxation than almost anyone and put it to work for the public interest. The Founding Fathers saw the phenomenon as flatly undemocratic. In his autobiography, Thomas Jefferson wrote of bills he had advocated to form “a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of antient [sic] or future aristocracy; and a foundation laid for a government truly republican.” His goal was to “prevent the accumulation and perpetuation of wealth in select families.” Jefferson would be appalled at the concentration of wealth in America today. Presumably he would find sound economic and social sense in taxing the hell out of excessive incomes and excessive wealth.	12	1	0	1

Hildebrand ($955,000) and Harold Hamm ($300,000). The billionaire contributors to the Victory Fund, a political action committee affiliated with the candidate’s reelection campaign committee, may have merely been showing their gratitude for Trump’s service to them over the last four years.

But many are only virtue signaling in the sadly rational expectation that their oxen won't be the ones that get gored. All of this lets the bill's proponents talk a good game while continuing to kowtow to some of their biggest donors. A more charitable—but still cynical—explanation is that those writing policy know that going after the easy-to-tax ordinary income of the working rich will be relatively easy and the working rich outnumber the superwealthy by a large margin, leading to far more revenue.	4	2	2	1

Sanders has conceded that he would apply a 4 percent tax to everyone making at least $29,000 and would also enact a new 7.5 percent payroll tax, which would in part be shouldered by middle-class workers (if paid by the employer, it is reasonable to assume that the result would be lower pay for workers to account for the new expense). Beyond that, MarketWatch reports, """"""""Sanders proposes a variety of progressive tax changes, including imposing a marginal tax rate of up to 70% on those making above $10 million, taxing earned and unearned income at the same rates, limiting tax deductions for filers in the top tax bracket, establishing a tax on extreme wealth and making the estate tax more progressive, including a 77% top rate on an inheritance above $1 billion.""""""""	1	0	0	1

From the outset, Mr. Biden has declared flatly that the 2020 race is above all about beating Mr. Trump—and that he is the candidate with the gravitas to do that. That turns to have been smart positioning. As it happens, Mr. Trump, by directing so much of his Twitter fire at Mr. Biden, actually seems to be helping him make this case, by suggesting he is the Democrat the president considers the biggest threat. —As a result of this Trump focus, this election may be more about values than ideology. Starting with his announcement video, Mr. Biden's message, implicit and explicit, has been that Mr. Trump's values and behavior, more than the policy debate, are the real issues in the 2020 campaign.	3	0	0	0

The most recent case concerns Sam Bankman-Fried, the would-be king of cryptocurrency, who is currently cooling his heels in a Bahamanian jail awaiting extradition to the U.S. on fraud charges. In his brief heyday, Bankman-Fried was an adherent and promoter of the concept of “effective altruism,” which held that if life’s purpose is to do good, then the moral imperative is to make as much money as one can, so that one can give it away. Among the many problems with this notion is that billionaires tend to give their money to causes that benefit them personally, rather than the public interest. They fund personal vanities like space travel by the billions of dollars, and fight efforts to raise the incomes of their employees through, say, unionization, to the last drop of blood. Effective altruism provides a ready pseudo-intellectual justification for such self-dealing: The more resources billionaires hoard, the more good they can do.	11	0	1	1

The lack of any discernible impact on economic growth or unemployment, moreover, debunks “supply-side theories that suggest lower taxes on the rich will induce labor supply responses from high-income individuals (more hours of work, more effort etc.) that boost economic activity.” This is the essence of the trickle-down theory and the lionization of rich people as “job creators.” At best, Hope and Limberg write, statistics show “very slight indications of a flash in the pan effect ... on unemployment,” but those indications are “neither statistically significant nor robust.”	6	0	0	1

For consumers, that meant gasoline prices that fell to an average $2.38 per gallon, compared with their peak of $3.70 in April. All told, the drop in oil prices was equivalent to an annual tax cut of about $750 per American family. And with the United States still importing an estimated 26 percent of its petroleum, lower prices raise the economy’s growth rate and reduce the balance of payments deficit. Economic news was not all positive. Most important, there were only hints that stagnating wages might finally be turning upward. November figures showed that the cash pay of hourly workers rose by a slender 0.8 percent after adjustment for inflation over the previous year. The picture is modestly better when cash benefits are added to the equation. In the past two years, median family incomes, including items such as pensions, Social Security and unemployment insurance, edged up to about $53,500 from $52,600 in 2012. But they have remained well below their previous peak of $57,500 in January 2008. The decline between 2009 and 2012 was the first time this inflation-adjusted measure had dropped during an economic recovery.	1	0	0	0
2021-11-08	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Thank you, Elon Musk. You've just proved why a billionaires tax is essential	txt-opeds/2594699721.xml.txt	There’s no evidence that any such idea was under consideration — especially given the reluctance of Democrats alike to raise taxes on the middle class, however it’s defined. No, the billionaires tax was aimed exactly where the label indicated, at America’s ever-fattened billionaire class. No one is more adept at evading taxes than the 1%, or at achieving changes in the tax code that benefit them legally. Musk’s pretense that taxing his majestic wealth will lead to higher taxes on ordinary Americans is just so much bluster. He’s protecting his own wealth, don’t think otherwise. His willingness to manipulate public sentiment to keep his own pockets filled is the best proof that a billionaires tax is desperately needed.	10	1	1	1

From the scale and nature of the indictments, we know that plenty of regular Americans got carried along into acts of destruction and violence. The general purpose was not peaceful protest. The crowd was gathered in Washington by the president with the specific intention of intimidating members of Congress (and the vice president) to abandon their duties and support a coup against the Constitution. Their leader stoked their anger, sent them marching to Capitol Hill, refused to intervene when the violence began and then gave their work a warm benediction.	3	0	0	0
2021-05-09	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: Biden wants to hike the capital gains tax. The wealthy will fight him to the death	txt-opeds/2524189424.xml.txt	The tax cut enacted by Republicans and signed by President Trump in 2017 provided some relief from the tax. In 2021, couples with income below $80,800 and single filers with income below $40,400 pay no capital gains tax. Those with income between $80,800 and $501,600 pay only 15% on capital gains (the range for singles is $40,400 to $445,850). But that gives only a hint of why the wealthy love the capital gains tax. As it was described by the late Edward Kleinbard, who reigned for years as the resident tax expert at USC, the capital gains tax is our only truly “voluntary” tax.	5	0	0	2

For the other 0.1, $100 billion, I would account that as part of the savings that we will get from the negotiation of prescription drug prices by Medicare and H.H.S., which I think narrowly that move alone C.B.O. had between $3 billion and $400 billion over a decade.

He can embrace his authentic, familiar self and make his competitors defend their positions. If Harris got to show how she'd take on Trump, Biden can show how Trump would paint them as extreme and unrealistic. Biden should ask Democratic opponents why the vast majority of Americans without a college education should subsidize the education of a minority of the population, a minority that is whiter and richer than the rest of America. He should make clear that the wealth tax is a poor way to raise revenue compared with his ideas (e.g. ending the step-up for those inheriting appreciated property and stock, narrowing the gap between rates for salary income and capital gains income). He should point out that there is no button marked """"""""End long wars,"""""""" but there is a way to reduce forces in Afghanistan and transition to a counter-terrorism role.

That top rate would surpass the 37% marginal federal income tax on ordinary income paid by joint filers with income of more than $622,000. By effectively extinguishing the capital gains preference, Biden would be crossing the tax Rubicon. No wonder that stock investors expressed their dismay with what almost seems like panic selling.

I was born two years later, in 1952, and lived in the same neighborhoods he lived in. Ara Guler’s Istanbul is my Istanbul. I first heard of Ara in the 1960s when I saw his photographs in Hayat, a widely read weekly news and gossip magazine with a strong emphasis on photography. One of my uncles edited it. Ara published portraits of writers and artists such as Picasso and Dali, and the celebrated literary and cultural figures of an older generation in Turkey such as the novelist Ahmet Hamdi Tanpinar.

This article is part of David Leonhardt’s newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Universal student-debt cancellation is a bad idea. It would be a big handout to Americans from upper-income families, most of whom are able to pay off their loans without too much trouble. “Education debt,” as Sandy Baum and Victoria Lee of the Urban Institute have written, “is disproportionately concentrated among the well-off.” (If you’re skeptical, I laid out the evidence in a recent column.) A much better idea would be an enormous investment in colleges that enroll large numbers of middle-class and lower-income students. These colleges tend to be underfunded and suffer from high dropout rates. This investment program could be combined with targeted debt forgiveness for those college graduates (and especially nongraduates) unable to repay their loans.	0	0	0	0

In Mr. Piketty’s opinion the solution to current inequality is a global wealth tax. There are no doubt other economically and politically feasible answers. Niall Ferguson on the conservative side and Robert B. Reich on the liberal side, among others, have suggested potential ways to reduce inequality.

2021-06-08	New York Times (Online)	The Real Tax Scandal Is What’s Legal	txt-opeds/2538661847.xml.txt	Wealthy Americans can save a lot of money by cheating on their federal income taxes, but that’s nothing compared with how much money they’ve been saving by following the rules. In a revealing examination of tax records for 25 of the wealthiest Americans, the journalism nonprofit ProPublica reported Tuesday that some of the nation’s most prominent billionaires declared relatively little taxable income in comparison with the rapid growth of their wealth. Jeff Bezos, for example, added an estimated $99 billion in wealth between 2014 and 2018 but reported only $4.22 billion in taxable income during that period. Warren Buffett, who amassed $24.3 billion in new wealth over those years, reported $125 million in taxable income.	0	0	1	1

2019-04-01	The Washington Post (Online)	Why the United States can’t become Nordic overnight	txt-opeds/2201498905.xml.txt	The Democrats' new proposals are the opposite of what makes Norway successful. A carbon tax is successful in Norway because consumers and producers, oil executives and labor unions understand that we all live on the same planet. The Green New Deal supported by many Democrats is the opposite. It is partisan, contentious and conceived as a foregone conclusion with little attempt to get buy-in from those who do not already agree with it. In Norway, politics is process. In the United States, it is trench warfare. In the 1970s, Americans had about the same trust in one another as Norwegians do now. The Cold War showed the need to stick together. Today the government is invisible to most Americans. In Norway we can see it: Our free universal health care and education are visible to all. Those monies, channeled through a state led by people we trust, bind the country together. In the United States, the trust in Congress is so low and the spectacle of the White House so surreal that the idea of government as a tool of common purpose seems quaint.	4	0	0	0

Saez and Zucman's entire narrative of a regressive U.S. tax system designed to favor the rich at the expense of the poor. The IRS reports effective income-tax rates on the adjusted gross incomes of different groups of earners. That's the percentage of income that people actually pay to the government, as distinct from the statutory tax rate. According to the IRS, the top 0.01% of earners—those with incomes above $10 million—paid a 24.8% effective federal income-tax rate in 2018. This isn't very different from the 25.3% the group paid in 2017, and is higher than the average rate of 22.5% on the same group during the George W. Bush administration. As these rates only encompass federal income taxes, most filers can expect to add another 8% to 12% of income from other forms of taxation, placing their total burden well above the Saez-Zucman numbers.	3	0	0	3

As Yair Rosenberg explained in a column for The Post: So is Trump a philo-Semite or an anti-Semite? The answer is both. The principle that explains his seemingly contradictory outlook toward Jews is simple: Trump believes all the anti-Semitic stereotypes about Jews. But he sees those traits as admirable. To Trump, the belief that Jews are foreign interlopers who use their wealth to serve their own clannish interests is not a negative — as it is for traditional anti-Semites — but rather a positive. He wants Jews to be his attorneys and manage his money, so that he, too, can be rich. He wants them in his political corner, so that he, too, can be powerful. He wants to buy politicians, just like he thinks they do. As a man who has always stood solely for his own naked self-interest, Trump does not see the anti-Semitic conception of the self-interested Jew as a complaint, but rather a compliment.	2	0	0	0

Assembly Bill 2088 proposes calculating the wealth tax based on current world-wide net worth each Dec. 31. For part-year and temporary residents, the tax would be proportionate based on their number of days in California. The annual tax would be on current net worth and therefore would include wealth earned, inherited or obtained through gifts or estates long before and long after leaving the state.	1	2	0	2

That's the optimistic view mouthed by Michael Reed, the CEO of New Media Investment Group, GateHouse's parent, on Nov. 14 after the deal was approved by shareholders of both companies. One would hope so, since the news business could use an injection of optimism these days. Perhaps there are grounds for hope, since the ""new Gannett,"" as Reed dubbed the combination, will have national-scale heft, creating the largest newspaper chain in the U.S., encompassing 263 daily news organizations.	0	0	0	0
2019-11-19	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Column: The future for local news looks bleak	txt-opeds/2413693401.xml.txt	But there may be just as much reason for doubt. The economic environment of local news continues to become more dismal as print advertising disappears and managements struggle to raise digital advertising and subscription fees enough to take up the slack. Advertisers have many online platforms to reach customers, and the vast majority of remaining newspaper readers are in the aging demographic that digital advertisers don't much care for. ""Since 2008, there hasn't been a single year of revenue gain in the newspaper industry as a whole,"" says veteran industry analyst Ken Doctor. That's produced a strategy of ""continuous cost-cutting for more than a decade in local news."" The cuts have come heavily in the form of layoffs at media companies of scores or hundreds of workers at a time.	1	0	0	0

Earlier this year, GateHouse reportedly laid off more than 60 employees (the company would not disclose the actual number but called it ""immaterial"") and Gannett reportedly laid off several hundred. The private equity firm Alden Capital, which owns the Orange County Register, Denver Post, San Jose Mercury News and more than 90 other publications and boasts a reputation as a pitiless parer of payroll, has attracted much of the publicly expressed ire over wholesale plundering of local news resources with good reason, for Alden publications have been cutting staff at about twice the rate of the industry as a whole.	2	0	0	0

But public companies such as Gannett, GateHouse and also McClatchy Co. can't escape the industry's economic challenges. Sacramento-based McClatchy, a chain of 30 newspapers including the Sacramento Bee, Miami Herald and Kansas City Star, may be another canary in the news industry's coal mine. McClatchy reported a loss of $304.7 million on revenue of $167.4 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 29. Most of the loss reflected a write-down of the company's news assets.	3	0	0	0

McClatchy said its finances were so impaired that it wouldn't have the cash or cash flow to make a required minimum contribution of $124 million to its pension fund next year and was negotiating a possible takeover of the plan by the government's Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. McClatchy's parlous condition has sent it on a quest for a merger partner. In December, the firm bid $16.50 per share for Tribune, the owner of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily News, Baltimore Sun and Hartford Courant, and the former owner of The Times.

For almost any news organization looking to the future, the imperative is to invest in digital capabilities, since that's where the news audience has been moving to. GateHouse hasn't been known for such investment. According to a 2018 survey by Penelope Muse Abernathy of the University of North Carolina, the firm's practice after acquiring a newspaper has been to ""consolidate copy editing and page design"" at a corporate center, then replace veteran and specialty reporters with younger (and cheaper) general assignment reporters.

It shouldn't escape notice that it's not always easy to reconcile using cash to pay shareholder dividends with ""investing for growth."" The increasingly common pattern is to operate local newspapers as sources of plunder.

The authors also boast about ""our enterprises...helping cure terrible and painful diseases from cancer to multiple sclerosis."" For perspective, consider that the single biggest funding agency of biomedical research in the world is the National Institutes of Health. The budget for the NIH, however, has consistently come under attack by the Trump administration, which this year proposed to cut it by $5 billion, or 13%.

But it certainly hasn’t been equally disastrous for everyone. If you thought the wealth gap between Ebenezer Scrooge and Bob Cratchit was vast in “A Christmas Carol,” the difference between the haves and have-nots in 2020 would be enough to make Charles Dickens’ head spin. What would Dickens write about today’s America, where the total wealth gains of America’s 650 billionaires have surpassed $1 trillion since March? Where Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune increase by $72 billion during the pandemic, while Amazon faces intense criticism for failing to keep its workers safe even as thousands of them fall ill? Where billionaires have reportedly given less than a tenth of 1% of their wealth to COVID-19 pandemic relief?	0	0	1	1

This holiday season alone, tens of millions of people —  1 in 6 Americans (disproportionately from communities of color) — don’t have enough to eat. As the pandemic hands windfall profits to the billionaire class, our nation’s charities, particularly those serving the disadvantaged, are running out of money. Without major investments, as many as 40% of nonprofits could close over the next year just as they’re needed to help rebuild communities most damaged by the pandemic and economic crises.	1	0	1	1
2020-12-24	Los Angeles Times (Online)	Op-Ed: The wealthiest Americans are putting Scrooge to shame	txt-opeds/2472285662.xml.txt	Racing to fill this gap, a group of 57 ultra-high-net-worth individuals (defined as those worth at least $30 million or the top 0.1%) and some of America’s most respected foundations and I launched the Crisis Charitable Commitment. The idea is to set standards for the minimum level of annual giving from America’s wealthiest individuals and foundations so that more money can flow to organizations that can put those funds to work right away. Those who meet the benchmark would set a powerful example for what philanthropy should be doing in this time of national crisis. The math is relatively simple. The wealthiest 0.1% have an estimated tax base of around $11 trillion, but give away only around 1% annually to charity. An additional $1 trillion is parked in private foundations (where only 5% annually has to go to charities) and donor-advised funds — for which wealthy contributors can enjoy tax benefits from both of as much as 74% (and even more in high-income-tax states like California).	2	0	1	1

The formula, like wealth tax proposals at the federal and state levels, is based on asset brackets, with higher percentages in higher brackets. For example, an individual with $500 million in assets should give a minimum of $13.25 million annually (donation levels rise significantly higher up the wealth ladder). A foundation with a $1-billion endowment should give $98 million — which is far more than the $50 million or the 5% of net asset value that foundations are required by law to spend annually.	3	2	2	1

Elon Musk, worth $167 billion, should be giving $8.1 billion. Mark Zuckerberg, worth $105 billion, should be giving $5 billion. Collectively, applying the CCC formula, these three would donate more than $22 billion in 2020. This would be a small share of their wealth, given that combined they’ve made an astronomical $267 billion during the pandemic.

But in 2020, not even the worst pandemic since 1918, the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression, or a country gripped with racial injustice and political discontent reminiscent of 1968 have yet compelled the nation’s billionaires to recognize their privilege and responsibility.

The program could just as well have been named the U.S. Taxpayer Graduate School, because that’s who almost certainly will be covering at least some of the gift. Griffin’s donation, you see, is likely to bring him a sizable federal income tax deduction. Its actual size is impossible to calculate without knowing more about Griffin’s specific tax situation.

Griffin ranked high on ProPublica’s list. The news organization found that he had “averaged an annual income of $1.7 billion from 2013 to 2018,” making him the fourth-highest income-earner in the country. His average tax rate was 29.2% in those years, ProPublica reported. That’s considerably lower than the top marginal tax rate, which currently is 37% on income over about $578,000 for single taxpayers. (Griffin, according to the latest biographical material, is divorced.) On the raw numbers, Griffin may be able to reduce his federal income tax bill by about $110 million through his donation to Harvard. Who would pick up the slack? You and me, that’s who.	2	0	1	1

Indeed, a spokesperson for Griffin acknowledged, as ProPublica reported last year, that his tax rate was “lowered by charitable contributions,” among other factors. The dirty little secret about how plutocrats finance the charitable deductions that get their names on distinguished institutions is only one aspect of Griffin’s gift that should concern all Americans. More broadly, it points to the wisdom of a wealth tax on American millionaires and billionaires. As we’ve noted in the past, concentration of wealth on the scale seen in America today would have appalled the Founding Fathers.	3	1	1	1

The announcement of a major donation on the scale of Griffin’s is typically accompanied by an accounting of the donor’s other charitable efforts. Usually, however, what passes for selfless charity is a mask for the rich to fund their personal hobby horses. A classic example of this identified in 2012 by then-Reuters columnist Felix Salmon (now at Axios) was a $100-million gift to the Central Park Conservancy of New York by hedge fund boss John Paulson — who happened to live a few doors down from the park.	4	0	1	1

One is lobbying to keep and augment their tax breaks. In 2020, for instance, Griffin contributed $54 million to a campaign fighting an Illinois ballot measure that would have raised the state’s marginal tax rate on incomes higher than $750,000 to about 8% from 5%. ProPublica estimated that the measure could have cost Griffin about $50 million a year. The measure was defeated.

The following year, Griffin moved his family and the headquarters of his Citadel hedge fund and Citadel Securities firm to Miami from Chicago. Griffin said tax considerations weren’t at issue, but unlike Illinois, Florida has no personal income tax. Since his move, he has become a major financial supporter of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

That ostensibly nonprofit institution has an endowment of more than $50 billion, the largest in the country. On what planet can a taxpayer-subsidized addition to this endowment be justified? We raised the same issue back in 2016, when Nike founder Phil Knight collected plaudits for making a $400-million gift to Stanford University, where he received a business degree.

A 2015 data survey by Nexus Research placed the discrepancy in stark relief by comparing the implicit per-student subsidy at rich private institutions with the government funding of public colleges in their state. In California, it showed that Stanford received about $63,000 per student, while UC Berkeley got $10,500, Cal State Fullerton got $4,000 and Fullerton Community College $8,100.

According to a 2015 survey by the Council for Aid to Education, nearly one-fifth of the record $40.3 billion raised by U.S. colleges and universities that year went to just 10 schools. Alumni and other individuals were the largest source of gifts, accounting for nearly 47% of the total. Through the tax deductions these donors claimed, taxpayers covered roughly $7.5 billion of the total donations. (That’s the amount donors would have had to pay into the federal treasury, were it not for the deductions.) None of this is to suggest that the philanthropic donations of Griffin or any other American plutocrats aren’t sincere and heartfelt. Among Griffin’s beneficiaries are the Obama Foundation, programs to bring internet access to low-income pupils, museums and COVID research programs.

Why then should its parent-teacher associations exacerbate inequality? New York’s P.T.A.s are doing exactly that, according to city data and reports from the city’s Independent Budget Office. Across the city, the disparities are stunning. Take the P.T.A. at Public School 29, an elementary school in the Cobble Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn with a low percentage of pupils living in poverty. The P.T.A. reported  it raised more than $1.7 million, or more than $1,800 per student, in the last school year. Compare that with P.S. 6X, West Farms, an elementary school in the Bronx with a high poverty rate among students, which reported raising just $5,793.82, or less than $11 per student.	0	0	0	1

The data is incomplete, self-reported and hasn’t been evaluated by the city. But a recent report from the Independent Budget Office, a nonpartisan city agency, shows a similar pattern. Of 132 schools reviewed by the budget office in the 2017-18 school year, the school with the lowest percentage of children living in poverty, 6 percent, received $437,000 from its P.T.A., while the school with the highest percentage of children living in poverty, 98 percent, received $2,500.

Those schools are using the additional funding for things like hiring art and music teachers and teaching assistants, according to the budget office and city education officials. That alone is upsetting. Art and music classes shouldn’t be a luxury offered to a privileged few, but should be standard in every school. Of course, parents have long used P.T.A.s to support their children’s schools, and it’s hard to begrudge them for doing so. But there’s also nothing wrong with asking New Yorkers who have more to help others — especially when the most insidious disparities in New York schools run far deeper than P.T.A. funding.	2	0	0	1

New York is one of dozens of districts in the country that distribute the funds through a formula meant to give additional funds to schools serving children who are living in poverty or who have special needs. But the state and city have never fully funded the high-need schools under the weighted system. In 2006, the State Supreme Court ruled that New York State was allocating about $2 billion less to New York City schools than was needed to provide the “sound basic education” required by the state’s Constitution. Despite an increase in funding since then, the settlement, in a case brought by the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, has never been fully funded. City officials and education experts say the state now owes the city more than $1.1 billion in this fiscal year alone.	3	0	0	0

At the same time, many city schools with wealthier students receive more than their share under the Fair Student Funding formula the city adopted in the 2007-8 school year, while nearly 300 high-poverty schools had shortfalls of more than $500,000 each, according to the budget office.

Though that might sound radical, it’s already in action elsewhere. In Portland, Ore., one-third of funds above $10,000 raised by parents in a P.T.A.-like system  are distributed to high-need schools through a fair-funding formula.

David Bloomfield, a professor of education law at Brooklyn College and the CUNY Graduate Center, said that in New York, a city with vast wealth but also grinding poverty, P.T.A.s could make a difference. “There should be a wealth tax,” he said of such a plan. Some said sharing P.T.A. funds might be more appealing if parents knew exactly how the money was being spent, and to what school it was being given. “When people fund-raise, they want to know where that money goes. I think parents would be superwilling to share if they knew it went directly to a school,” said Emily Hellstrom, a former P.T.A. president who leads the Students With Disabilities Committee at Community Education Council District 2, in Manhattan. Ms. Hellstrom said asking parents to give money to a general fund overseen by the Department of Education was unlikely to go over very well. “It’s a vast wasteland of bureaucracy,” she said.	6	1	0	1

More than a third of those P.T.A.s are in New York City. Scott Sargrad, the center’s vice president for education policy for kindergarten through 12th grade, said that P.T.A. funds amounting to more than several hundred dollars per student in a school with few students living in poverty can worsen disparities and pay for programs that should be funded by schools directly.	7	0	0	1

Then, when oil prices fell, his successor tried to cover the income gap by printing money. Hence the crisis.

And journalists find the argument alluring because it has a ring of tough skepticism, and we journalists love to present ourselves as tough skeptics. In this case, though, it’s important to be skeptical about the skepticism. Over the last few decades, the total federal tax rate paid by the very rich has tended to hover between 30 percent and 40 percent.

The top marginal rate has plummeted. Taxes on stock holdings have declined, too. Perhaps nothing has mattered more than the erosion of the estate tax, through a combination of a lower rate and an increased threshold for paying the tax. These policy changes have helped turbocharge economic inequality. Is it possible to tax the wealthy too heavily and damage the economy? Yes. I don’t think the top marginal tax rate should be 91 percent, as it was in the 1950s. But it’s a very, very long way from 91 percent today. It’s only 37 percent, which is too low.

Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	Imagine for a moment that a presidential candidate made this speech: My fellow Americans, I’m here today to tell you about my economic plan. Each year, I will require every middle-class family across this great country to write a check. We will then pool the money and distribute it to the richest Americans among us — the top 1 percent of earners, who, because of their talent, virtue and success, deserve even more money. The exact size of the checks will depend on a family’s income, but a typical middle-class household will hand over $15,000 each year. This plan, I promise all of you, will create the greatest version of America that has ever existed.	0	0	0	1
2019-02-03	New York Times (Online)	What’s Really Radical? Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	You would consider that proposal pretty radical, wouldn’t you? Politically crazy. Destructive, even. Well, I’ve just described the actual changes in the American economy since the 1970s. [ Sign up for David Leonhardt’s daily newsletter — with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web. ] Economic output — known as G.D.P. — per person has almost doubled over this period. But the bulk of the bounty has flowed to the very rich. The middle class has received relative crumbs. If middle-class pay had increased as fast as the economic growth, the average middle-class family would today earn about $15,000 a year more than it does, after taxes and benefits. Instead, that middle-class family effectively forfeits the money to the rich, year after year after year. (Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary, first got me thinking about calculations like these.)	1	0	1	1
2019-02-03	New York Times (Online)	What’s Really Radical? Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	The extreme redistribution of income — upward — has multiple causes. Some of them, like technological change, stem mostly from private-sector forces. But government policy plays a crucial role. Tax rates on the wealthy have fallen sharply . Labor unions have been undermined . Big companies have been allowed to grow even bigger and more powerful. The United States has lost its lead as the most educated country in the world. More often than not over the past 40 years, our government has helped the rich at the expense of everyone else. As a result, economic inequality has reached Gilded Age levels.	2	0	1	1
2019-02-03	New York Times (Online)	What’s Really Radical? Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	In the face of these trends, the radical response is to do nothing — or to make inequality even worse , as President Trump’s policies have. It’s radical because soaring inequality is starting to threaten the basic fabric of American life. Many people have grown frustrated and cynical. Average life expectancy, amazingly, has fallen over the past few years. Over the sweep of history, the main reason that societies have declined, as the scholars Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have written , is domination “by a narrow elite that have organized society for their own benefit at the expense of the vast mass of people.” The name of Acemoglu’s and Robinson’s book on this phenomenon is, “Why Nations Fail.”	3	0	1	1
2019-02-03	New York Times (Online)	What’s Really Radical? Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	It’s worth keeping all of this in mind when you hear critics (or journalists) describe the economic proposals of the Democratic presidential candidates as “radical.” They’re not radical, for the most part. The proposals are instead efforts to undo some of the extreme economic changes of recent decades and to ensure that most Americans workers — not just a narrow elite — fully benefit from economic growth. The proposals also happen to be popular, broadly speaking. On social issues, like abortion and immigration, the country is deeply divided. But clear majorities support higher taxes on the wealthy, higher taxes on corporations, more education funding and expanded government health insurance. No wonder: Americans don’t resent success, but they do resent not receiving their fair share of economic growth.	4	0	1	1
2019-02-03	New York Times (Online)	What’s Really Radical? Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	The coming primary campaign will be a good time for the candidates to hash out which specific ideas make sense and which don’t . So far, the agenda looks pretty good. Elizabeth Warren has a plan to increase workers’ power within companies — and help them get larger pre-tax raises. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris want to lift the after-tax pay of the middle class and poor. Kirsten Gillibrand and others support reducing major living costs, like child care and education. Perhaps most important, some Democrats have begun pushing for a wealth tax — to reverse the upward redistribution of the past 40 years. Warren has proposed an annual 2 or 3 percent tax on large fortunes. Bernie Sanders has proposed a big increase in the inheritance tax.	5	1	0	1
2019-02-03	New York Times (Online)	What’s Really Radical? Not Taxing the Rich	txt-opeds/2175146638.xml.txt	These wealth taxes are a classic example of policies that are less radical than their opponents claim. Do you know who already pays a wealth tax? Middle-class Americans. It’s called the property tax, as Noah Smith of Bloomberg Opinion has noted. Every year, homeowners pay a percentage of their house value in tax. A house, of course, is the biggest asset that most families own. If middle-class families can pay an annual tax on their main source of wealth, wealthy families can, too. The United States as we have known it — optimistic, future-oriented and more powerful than any other nation — cannot survive the stagnation of mass living standards over many decades. I’m glad to see that some political leaders understand this and are trying to recapture a core feature of American life.	6	1	1	1

Re “How Buttigieg Became Surprise of the Caucuses” (front page, Feb. 8): A political party that has serious problems with addressing people in small towns and Middle America is behaving foolishly. Pete Buttigieg can and should argue that he has faced the issues troubling a great swath of this country.

(Try saying that 10 times fast.) I'm Catherine Rampell. A confession: My own interests and skills typically lean more toward policy analysis rather than horse-race prognostication. But lucky for me (and maybe, um, America?), this horse race is unusually driven by policy debates. Woohoo! Yeah, sure, there are still plenty of stories about candidates' likability, temperament, age, genealogical claims and so on. But in the past several weeks, we've also seen splashy proposals from 2020 hopefuls on: • Medicare for All/Medicare for More/Medicare for Anyone Who Wants It: It's everywhere.	0	0	0	0

Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) proposal released Monday. • Paid leave — Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) introduced legislation last week. • Taxes — Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) introduced legislation last week to expand the earned-income tax credit; Warren's wealth tax is still getting play. For wonks, the investment that 2020 contenders are making in policy, especially early in the race, is encouraging. It suggests they believe voters are hungry not just for anti-Trump fervor or a good personal story but also substantive ideas for how to better Americans' lives. But it's unclear whether voters are paying close attention to these proposals. A third of voters who say they support the Green New Deal, for instance, also say such a proposal should focus only on climate change, not the many social justice initiatives also in the resolution.	1	2	0	1

Some plans introduced as legislation in current or previous Congresses were sponsored by one 2020 candidate but also endorsed or co-sponsored by some of that candidate's fellow 2020 contenders. In the months ahead, watch for how the candidates differentiate themselves — and whether they start turning on one another or, at the least, stop cooperating. Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-Vt.) entrance could sharpen divisions, too. One reason so many of the senators running for office have signed on to competing policy ideas is that they've been trying to straddle the ""progressive"" and ""moderate"" lanes.

2020-04-08	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders is out. And the insincere praise begins.	txt-opeds/2387534568.xml.txt	Quite belatedly, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) announced Wednesday that he is ending his presidential campaign. The race was effectively over on Super Tuesday, but Sanders and his devoted Bernie Bros are not known for their selfless devotion to party, so his futile race dragged on for another month. Perhaps he stayed in an attempt to increase Democratic turnout in Wisconsin to help oust a right-wing state supreme court justice. Or maybe he would have stayed in even longer, but the sight of people endangering themselves to vote during a pandemic was simply too much to bear. In any case, his second run — far less effective than his first — is over.	0	0	0	0
2020-04-08	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders is out. And the insincere praise begins.	txt-opeds/2387534568.xml.txt	Democrats, aided by the mainstream media, are now putting out two rather disingenuous storylines. First, ""No one ever changed the party as much as Sanders."" Second, ""Now begins the struggle to win over the Bernie Bros."" It is understandable that some Democrats — eager to avoid a schism similar to that which occurred in 2016 — are falling over themselves to assuage Sanders's ego, but let's not get carried away. The ""Bernie changed the party"" line suggests that the party did not overwhelmingly choose a center-left successor to President Barack Obama. But it did! And it has rallied around someone who rejected Medicare-for-all, a wealth tax, left-wing isolationism and the entire ""capitalism is evil"" stance. Sanders got beaten badly week after week, never changing his message. That message simply did not register with more than about 30 percent of the party. Twitter does not represent the party. The party did not shift far left, as many in the media predicted (egged on by the loudest voices on the left). If anything, Biden's wins show that the heart of the party rests with moderate African Americans — to whom all Americans are indebted for lifting a viable, electable nominee to oust President Trump. Sanders's ""movement"" is far smaller than he would have liked us to believe.	1	0	0	0
2020-04-08	The Washington Post (Online)	Bernie Sanders is out.

It is hard to fathom the mindset of someone who would prefer an unfit narcissist who opposes virtually every principle and value Democrats hold dear to Obama's vice president. It is of a piece with those who preferred Jill Stein in 2016. There is no reaching such people. Soliciting them is a waste of time. The rest of the Sanders coalition should not need much courting. They've already signaled they will line up behind Biden and have expressed their determination to oust Trump. Other than not gratuitously attacking them, no great effort should be required to keep them in the fold. (Ironically, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has been far more successful in advancing progressive policy ideas with Biden, including her plans on student debt forgiveness and bankruptcy.)	2	0	0	0

2019-06-30	The Washington Post (Online)	A wealth tax isn’t the best way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2249636093.xml.txt	A HOST of public opinion data confirms that Americans favor higher taxes on the wealthy. It would seem that taxing the rich is so popular that even the rich are for it, or at least some of them. An open letter published June 24 by 19 very wealthy people, including Abigail Disney and George Soros, declared that ""America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more."" Billionaire Eli Broad chimed in with a pro-wealth-tax New York Times op-ed. Certainly their self-abnegating spirit is consistent with the policy tendency that Democratic candidates expressed during their first debates; and the letter spoke favorably of a direct tax on wealth similar to the one Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has proposed, which would put a 2 percent levy on assets above a $50 million threshold and 3 percent on assets over $1 billion.	0	1	0	1
2019-06-30	The Washington Post (Online)	A wealth tax isn’t the best way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2249636093.xml.txt	We couldn't agree more with the letter writers that the United States needs to raise more federal revenue and that ""the next dollar of new tax revenue should come from the most financially fortunate, not from middle-income and lower-income Americans."" Undeniably, too, the 2017 tax law that President Trump and a Republican Congress enacted showered billions of dollars worth of tax relief on upper-income people and businesses. Incredibly, news reports indicate the Trump administration is considering executive action to create yet another tax reduction that primarily benefits the rich — indexing capital gains to inflation. This would fly in the face of public opinion and, more importantly, could cost the treasury between $10 billion and $20 billion per year, according to Leonard E. Burman of the Tax Policy Center.	1	0	2	1
2019-06-30	The Washington Post (Online)	A wealth tax isn’t the best way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2249636093.xml.txt	Unlike the open letter's authors and Ms. Warren, however, we are not convinced that a wealth tax is the optimal means of raising taxes on those who can afford to pay more. In addition to a likely constitutional challenge, the measure would encounter implementation problems — especially the consistent valuation of assets ranging from land to rare art — similar to those that have caused most European nations that tried a wealth tax to abandon it. Indeed, it's all too likely that a wealth tax would bring in less revenue than advocates anticipate, in part because millionaires can afford the best accountants and lawyers. What's more, a wealth tax of the kind Ms. Warren proposes would not distinguish between wealth accumulated through enterprise and innovation, which is socially productive, and wealth gained through inheritance or rent-seeking, which is not.	2	3	0	2
2019-06-30	The Washington Post (Online)	A wealth tax isn’t the best way to tax the rich	txt-opeds/2249636093.xml.txt	A better approach would be to repeal those provisions of the 2017 tax law that restored favored treatment to large estates; to reduce the favorable treatment of capital gains in general; and to eliminate the huge break for profits on the sale of stock by people who inherit it from rich benefactors. These measures are all clearly constitutional, all readily administrable by the existing Internal Revenue Service apparatus — and all well-calculated to raise substantial amounts from the top 1 percent, or less, of the income scale. A wealth tax is certainly a bold and spectacular proposal; what the country needs most, however, are effective ones.	3	3	0	1

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.) had an exchange that tells you almost everything you need to know about the Warren campaign, and even the broader Democratic contest. It happened when moderator Andrea Mitchell lobbed her a softball question about uniting the country, and Warren batted it away with a paean to her favorite policy: stiff wealth taxation. ""The way we achieve our goals and bring our country together,"" said Warren, ""is we talk about the things that unite us, and that is that we want to build an America that works for the people, not one that just works for rich folks."" There was more, but that opening statement neatly summarizes the gist of this message, which Warren hammers at every possible opportunity.	0	3	0	2

He acknowledged the need for more tax revenue, of course, to fund the spending Democrats want to do. ""But here's the challenge. We as Democrats need to fight for a just taxation system. But as I travel around the country, we Democrats also have to talk about how to grow wealth, as well."" And there, in a few simple words, is the choice Democrats face: between an economic moderate who thinks that growing the size of the economic pie has to be an important part of the Democratic agenda, and a full-blown progressive who just wants to carve it up differently.	1	3	0	2
2019-11-21	The Washington Post (Online)	What Cory Booker gets about a wealth tax that Elizabeth Warren doesn’t	txt-opeds/2316680689.xml.txt	This will not, of course, be news to anyone who has been paying attention. What's somewhat more interesting is their respective constituencies. Booker is overperforming among nonwhite voters, who tend to be not just lower-income but more socially conservative, and more focused on bread-and-butter issues, than white Democrats. Warren, on the other hand, is the candidate of the affluent, the educated and the white, what Republican polling firm Echelon Insights recently dubbed the ""Acela Party."" It might seem a bit strange that wealth taxes are being promulgated by a candidate who caters to white professionals with healthy household balance sheets, while the former mayor of Newark is making such investment-bankerly noises. But in fact there's a certain logic to it. After all, wealth taxes — as Booker ably pointed out — don't really make much sense as a technocratic policy matter.	2	3	0	2
2019-11-21	The Washington Post (Online)	What Cory Booker gets about a wealth tax that Elizabeth Warren doesn’t	txt-opeds/2316680689.xml.txt	If you want to spend a bunch of money on new social programs, a value-added tax is harder to evade and raises a lot more revenue; a tax on capital income is more economically efficient and just as progressive; a broad-based and highly progressive income tax is much easier to administer; and if you think that billionaires get that way by doing something socially harmful, regulating or taxing that specific activity would be more effective at ending their malfeasance. None of these methods carry the heavy risk, inherent to a wealth tax, that America's capital base will erode, and then productivity will erode, and then worker incomes will shrink.	3	3	2	1
2019-11-21	The Washington Post (Online)	What Cory Booker gets about a wealth tax that Elizabeth Warren doesn’t	txt-opeds/2316680689.xml.txt	But there is one thing a wealth tax can do better than anything else: destroy fortunes. That money doesn't necessarily go to anyone else, mind you; it may just get eaten up by compliance costs and dead-weight losses. But the rich people definitely won't have it. This is a fairly useless policy goal unless you happen to be in direct competition with wealthy people for social status and scarce resources such as elite school places. The best way to understand a wealth tax, in other words, is not in terms of rich and poor but as an intra-elite battle. The two sides are characterized by what New York Times columnist David Brooks once dubbed ""status-income disequilibrium."" One side consists of people whose elite jobs are well-paid compared with the national average but poorly paid compared with similarly educated and successful people in more mercenary fields, and who can therefore generally only access the best resources by leveraging family money, professional prestige or social capital. On the other side are those with more lucrative occupations who crassly buy their way in.	4	3	0	2
2019-11-21	The Washington Post (Online)	What Cory Booker gets about a wealth tax that Elizabeth Warren doesn’t	txt-opeds/2316680689.xml.txt	Heavy wealth taxation helps the former group by kneecapping their opponents without much touching their own, less tangible forms of social capital. Better still, this sounds like it does something for the poor, allowing them, and Warren, to congratulate themselves that they're really a finer grade of person, rather than some self-interested boob who votes from the pocketbook. It's a startlingly apt summation of so much of Warren's campaign: policies that sound like they help the poor while somehow delivering the greatest benefits to the educated elites of the Acela Corridor. Booker obviously understands the reality underlying the polished populist veneer. The only question is whether Democratic voters will.	5	3	0	1

They can do so in a number of ways: by making the case that these two progressive candidates should work together (as Democracy for America did), by waiting to endorse (as many labor unions are doing), by endorsing both Sanders and Warren, or, as the American Prospect's Harold Meyerson put it, simply by making Sanders and Warren a greater priority than Sanders vs. Warren.	2	0	0	0

Progressive Democrats should unite for the sake of the American people, whose lives would improve as a result of Medicare-for-all, a Green New Deal, a wealth tax, student-debt cancellation and other progressive policies being debated on the national stage. Progressives who, both before this latest back-and-forth and now, are lifting up both Sanders and Warren, are being principled and strategic. In our winner-take-all political system, the candidate who wins the nomination controls the direction of the party. Multiple progressive front-runners only increase the party's chances of having a left-of-center nominee and uniting around a left-of-center platform. Establishment Democrats, after all, will be united in their goal to keep the center of the Democratic Party at the core of the Democratic Party. Former secretary of labor Robert Reich remarked recently, ""If progressive Democrats don't hang together, corporate Democrats will hang them separately.""	3	1	0	1

Those efforts continue. They are sapping the progressive movement of its focus on the issues that matter to the American people, and dampening the enthusiasm of supporters past, present and potential. That's no way to expand the progressive lane. And a fractured movement foreshadows trouble for progressives at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee. With the possibility of a brokered convention, progressives would be better off entering with 50 percent or more of the delegates. Reaching that critical threshold between Sanders and Warren would increase the likelihood that a progressive candidate could obtain the nomination on the first ballot, before superdelegates weigh in and establishment forces may be better positioned to seize power.	4	0	0	0

But in a primary in which some centrist candidates believe that collecting $2,800 checks from lobbyists is the same as collecting only grass-roots dollars, in which we are weighing the boldness of the candidates' health-care plans and the levelheadedness with which they'd redefine the United States' role in the world, there are bigger issues for progressives to tackle than each other. Ultimately, progressives uniting in 2020 will be the only way progressives win in 2020.	5	0	0	0

Look no further than California Gov. Gavin Newsom's new Task Force on Business and Jobs Recovery, which will be led by Tom Steyer—yes, the San Francisco billionaire who ran for President on a wealth tax, carbon-free economy and slavery reparations.

Mr. Newsom was the first Governor to order citizens to stay home and nonessential businesses to shut down. This may have reduced infections, but some 3.1 million Californians have filed for unemployment benefits over the past month, more than in all of 2008, and most were already struggling to get by.

Gas prices in California still average $2.81 per gallon—a buck more than the national average. Congress has authorized an extra $600 per week in enhanced jobless benefits, but this won't go far in San Francisco where the average rent is $3,500. Paycheck Protection Program loans won't help most businesses in the state because they spend more on rent, property taxes and utilities than on payroll. This may explain why California has the lowest PPP loan disbursements as a share of small business payroll in the country.	2	0	0	0

Seattle was the first major U.S. city to adopt a $15 minimum wage and one of the first to require businesses to provide paid sick leave. The City Council achieved another first last week, when it unanimously enacted an ordinance requiring food-delivery app companies to provide gig workers ""premium pay"" for deliveries in the city, on top of their usual compensation, and prohibiting the companies from raising fees or leaving the city in response, even if the new rule causes them to lose money. Instead of erecting a wall to keep people out, Seattle is attempting to create a legal wall to keep businesses in.	0	0	0	1

On-demand delivery workers in the city—think Instacart shoppers and DoorDash couriers—must be paid a premium of $2.50 a stop in the city for the duration of the Covid-19 emergency declared by Mayor Jenny Durkan. With thousands of homebound Seattle residents in need of grocery deliveries, the costs add up. The City Council expects the companies to eat it: The ordinance states that gig companies may not ""reduce or otherwise modify the areas in the City that are served,"" ""reduce a gig worker's compensation,"" or ""add customer charges to online orders for delivery of groceries"" in response to the new premium. If a company violates the ordinance, the city can pursue it with penalties beyond the city limits.	1	0	0	0

If that sounds illegal, it probably is. In a detailed sent in May to Mayor Durkan, the trade group TechNet described how the ordinance would violate the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. By ""forcing a business to continue unprofitable operations, the City would be extracting payments from an unwilling person and thus taking private property without any—let alone just—compensation."" That isn't the only problem.

In 2017 it passed a ""wealth tax"" on the income of wealthy households, even though the city attorney had advised that it would be illegal under state law. The courts agreed, and in April the state Supreme Court denied the city's bid to review the decision. The city also recently walked away from a long legal dispute over a 2015 law that gave Uber and Lyft drivers, who use apps provided by the companies to work as independent contractors, the right to bargain collectively. Seattle may believe it has the budget to back another costly legal fight, but other municipalities—whose budgets are strained as a consequence of the coronavirus crisis—will think twice before imitating the ordinance.	3	3	0	2

Democrats in Sacramento are proposing to raise the state's already punitive 13.3% top income tax rate to 16.8%—retroactive to January of this year. Now's a good time for California high-earners to take their money and run. The Assembly bill would raise the top rate to 14.3% for households making more than $1 million, 16.3% on income above $2 million and 16.8% above $5 million. The combined federal-California top marginal tax rate would rise to 53.8% on wage income and 40.6% on capital gains.

They're counting on an election sweep in November so Congress will ease the state's tax penalty by repealing the $10,000 federal cap on the state-and-local tax deduction. Yet Joe Biden is promising to raise the federal top rate to 39.6% from 37% and tax capital gains at the same rate as wage income. This would mean the effective rate on capital gains in California would increase to 49.7% plus the federal 3.8% surtax on investment income.	1	0	0	2

So well-to-do Californians couldn't even shelter their money in the Cayman Islands or Switzerland. Democrats say the income-tax hike would only hit the top 0.5% of taxpayers and the wealth tax would nab the top 0.1%. But the top 0.5% currently pay 40% of the state's income-tax revenue—$32 billion in 2018—and are mobile. California has experienced an accelerating exodus of high earners since the state in 2012 raised taxes on individuals making more than $250,000. In 2018 the state lost $8 billion in adjusted gross income to other states, up from $135 million in 2012, according to IRS data.	2	2	0	3

Even before the pandemic, government unions had launched a referendum to eliminate California's tax cap on commercial property.

Don't laugh. Those are among the easy-to-meet terms laid down by the United Teachers Los Angeles union before they will return to the classroom to teach children in September. And here you thought the debate over reopening America's schools was about health and safety. The union does lay out an extensive list of safety requirements that go well beyond federal guidelines.

From Washington, the union wants another ""federal bailout"" of half a trillion dollars this year for K-12 schools and state and local governments. (The previous bill gave education $30 billion.) It also wants Medicare for All to combat the ""boundless greed of the for-profit health industry."" Of California, the union demands that the state's ""record number of millionaires and billionaires finally pay their fair share""—and put the money toward education. It stipulates support for a fall ballot initiative that would increase commercial and industrial property taxes. And it wants a new wealth tax on the capital gains of billionaires and a 1% to 3% surtax on Californians making more than $1 million annually.

Superintendent Austin Beutner admitted that children are ""struggling to learn online"" and that there may be a ""lifelong impact"" if kids don't soon return to the classroom. Yet he also echoed union talking points and said reopening hinged on more federal dollars. By now you may be getting the idea that the union really doesn't want its members to return to work. Or they're using the pandemic as leverage to extort more money from taxpayers that they couldn't get otherwise. Either way it's a demonstration of how far left the nation's public unions have moved.

That's 31% more than in 2019, the last pre-Covid year, which is staggering enough. But the real budget news that Washington would prefer that Americans not know is that tax revenue is booming. The money has been rolling in, as the most recent Congressional Budget Office figures show. In the first five months of fiscal 2022 through February, federal receipts climbed a remarkable 26% from a year earlier. That's $371 billion more—to $1.8 trillion in five months.

Individual income taxes for fiscal 2021 rose $436 billion, or 27%, to reach $2.04 trillion, which CBO notes was a function of ""workers with relatively high incomes who face higher tax rates."" Income taxes equalled 9.1% of GDP, well above the 50-year average of 7.9%. Corporate income taxes climbed 75.5%, or $160 billion, to $372 billion.

Revenue also flowed in late in calendar 2021 as some investors cashed out in anticipation of a possible tax increase that so far hasn't happened. (Though it still might if the White House gets its way; see nearby on its new wealth tax.) But an under-appreciated reason for the Beltway boom is inflation, which is pushing more taxpayers into higher tax brackets as their nominal incomes rise. Inflation also raises nominal corporate profits. Washington won't admit it, but inflation is good for the government while it lasts—though it can lead to crushing new deficits when the music stops.	2	2	0	3
